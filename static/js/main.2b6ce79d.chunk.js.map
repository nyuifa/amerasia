And this is\\n  nearer the truth, in concordance and agreement with the tradition of\\n  authorities, both in terms of the wealth of the same region and in terms of\\n  its power, for indeed earlier accounts revealed that the town of Themixitian\\n  is situated on a salt lake and that it far surpasses the city of Venice in\\n  splendor and size: here are the palace of the eastern emperor sometimes called\\n  the Great Khan (referred to by Hernán Cortés conversely as Monti Zuma), very\\n  magnificent houses, [and] sovereignty over all the neighboring peoples and\\n  regions. What writers report of the greatness and wealth and dominion of this\\n  [region] and the emperor and the city is marvelous and almost beyond belief.\\n  Some of the inhabitants are idolaters and others Christian, for Christ’s\\n  Gospel is always planted by the hands of the brothers of the Order of Saint\\n  Francis not only in Themixtitan but also throughout Greater Asia.

Before this painting,\\n  parrots had not often been included in religious imagery.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_lipsman_edn3\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_lipsman_ednref3\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[3]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  To understand the parrot’s presence in this image and its increasing\\n  popularity after Columbus’s initial voyages to the lands we now know as the\\n  Americas, we need to examine the bird’s association with Paradise.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  During the Middle Ages in Europe it was widely believed that Eden was in the\\n  East. The parrots Europe traded for were primarily Asian birds. In recognizing\\n  these two points, the connection between parrots and Paradise becomes\\n  apparent. They had been paired with other exotic birds, like their fellow\\n  Indian species, the peacock, in depictions of Paradise. This context makes the\\n  individual parakeet’s inclusion in van Eyck’s pre-Columbus painting all the\\n  more puzzling.<a href=\\\"#_lipsman_edn4\\\" name=\\\"_lipsman_ednref4\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[4]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  The painting does not depict a garden or an outdoor scene at all. Instead, the\\n  canon kneels in prayer with Saints Donation and George flanking the panel and\\n  the Virgin, Child, and parakeet enthroned as a trio in the center. The\\n  animal’s ability to speak gives us some explanation for its association with\\n  Eden and account for its presence in van Eyck’s panel.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The speaking bird was thought to say “<i>Ave</i>” in greeting, just as the\\n  archangel Gabriel had said to the Virgin Mary in the Annunciation. Dominican\\n  Franciscus di Retza wrote of the bird’s word in connection with Gabriel’s\\n  greeting, linking the parrot with the angel and the Annunciation.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_lipsman_edn5\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_lipsman_ednref5\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[5]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  In addition to voice, the impermeability of the parrot’s green feathers was\\n  associated with Mary’s virginity. The combination of these elements identify\\n  the bird as an “angelic messenger.”<a\\n    href=\\\"#_lipsman_edn6\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_lipsman_ednref6\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[6]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  Beyond the association with the Virgin, Carol Purtle explains that because the\\n  Christ Child is playing with the bird, the parakeet places the scene in\\n  heaven, rather than in an earthly paradise.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_lipsman_edn7\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_lipsman_ednref7\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[7]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  Instead of having it serve as a messenger to the Virgin, van Eyck\\n  intentionally placed the parrot in Christ’s hands, relating it to both the\\n  Child and His mother. Mary and Christ were often understood to be the new Adam\\n  and Eve, and the bird positioned between them may allude to this succession.\\n  By making the viewer recall the original residents of Paradise, the parrot’s\\n  presence works with the silk hung behind the group.

After\\n  Columbus’s voyages and the arrival of American parrots in Europe however, we\\n  see parrots appear in art more often. We also see a greater diversity in the\\n  species represented. Soon after Columbus’s voyages, we see ever more frequent\\n  depictions of macaws, a group of parrot subspecies native to the Americas.\\n  Over the course of the 16<sup>th</sup>century, Europeans became accustomed to\\n  these new parrots and began depicting them alongside African and Asian\\n  species. By the 17<sup>th</sup>century, parrots of all kinds were relatively\\n  common in Europe and appeared with some regularity in still lives as well as\\n  narrative scenes.<a href=\\\"#_lipsman_edn11\\\" name=\\\"_lipsman_ednref11\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[11]</sup></a\\n  >\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Many visitors to the new lands across the Atlantic remarked upon the large\\n  flocks of parrots found there. Some took finding a species associated with\\n  India as a sign that they were in India, or somewhere like it. In October of\\n  1492, Columbus wrote, “other than parrots, I have seen no beast of any kind on\\n  this island.”<a href=\\\"#_lipsman_edn12\\\" name=\\\"_lipsman_ednref12\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[12]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  He refers to parrots several more times in his journals describing first\\n  voyage.

Though he is depicting unexplored territory, Cantino follows Columbus’s\\n  example and assimilates it into Europe’s existing understanding of the world\\n  by describing it as part of India. The familiar green parrots of modern-day\\n  Senegal and African Grey Parrots of Central Africa are contrasted with the\\n  bright red macaws of America. The depiction of a species on more than one\\n  continent is atypical, even of later maps. Cartographers usually used animals\\n  to mark differences between places.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Here on the Vopel Map<i>, </i>Cabral’s “land of the parrots” is indicated\\n  twice. First, it appears in its Latin translation, “ <i>Papagalli</i>\\n  <i> terra” </i>on the landmass we now recognize as South America. The second\\n  appearance of parrots is in a fictional land placed in the same location as\\n  Antarctica. They are depicted in the eastern half of a land mass labeled as “\\n  Antarcticus ” and “Terra Australis nondum cognita ,” which translates to\\n  “Southern land not yet known”. This phrase often included when maps depict\\n  Terra Australis.\\n  <a href=\\\"#_lipsman_edn19\\\" name=\\\"_lipsman_ednref19\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[19]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  The birds are represented by an illustration of three parrots accompanied by\\n  the phrase “ Psitacorum Terra” – the Latin translation of Cabral’s words.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The effort to distribute flora and fauna geographically was complicated by the\\n  absence of a clear taxonomic system. Although of different subspecies and\\n  modern taxonomic families, monkeys and parrots could be found in Africa, Asia,\\n  and South America.<a href=\\\"#_lipsman_edn20\\\" name=\\\"_lipsman_ednref20\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[20]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  The effort to represent traditionally understood distributions even as new\\n  species within these orders were encountered may have contributed to the\\n  understanding that the Americas were an extension of Asia. This interpretation\\n  of the new lands may account for why, after Columbus’s voyages, parrots appear\\n  less in places believed to be Asia in the East and more in places believed to\\n  be Asia in the West. The assembling of different species under the order\\n  Psitacciformes became representative of the “New World” as a whole, the place\\n  where East and West meet.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Because the Americas were originally considered by Europeans to be a\\n  continuation of Asia around the other side of the world, it was logical to\\n  place Eden, in the farthest East: in the Americas. The first known use of a\\n  parrot in a Temptation scene is Albrecht Dürer’s 1504\\n  <i\\n    ><a\\n      href=\\\"https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/the-fall-of-man-adam-and-eve/iQHbY2Sl7lrL0A\\\"\\n      target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n      >Adam and Eve</a\\n    ></i\\n  >\\n  <i> </i>engraving.<a href=\\\"#_lipsman_edn21\\\" name=\\\"_lipsman_ednref21\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[21]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  Erwin Panofsky’s analysis of the bird above Adam suggests that its presence is\\n  meant to offset the evil of the serpent behind Eve. This is consistent with\\n  pre-Columbian associations between parrots and the purity of virginity. The\\n  long tail on Dürer’s parrot indicates an American species. Dürer had three\\n  parrots in his household: his wife had a small green one, likely to be an\\n  Indian bird, and he received one from Málaga.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_lipsman_edn22\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_lipsman_ednref22\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[22]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  It is unclear if the third parrot was a second green one or a second from\\n  Málaga but it is reasonable to guess that it came as one in a pair. We do not\\n  know what species Dürer’s parrot was, but coming from a city on the coast of\\n  Spain, it is likely that it was a macaw from the Americas.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Though parrots became more common in Europe through trade, they maintained\\n  their status as exotic and representative of the New World, that is, lands at\\n  the ends of the earth from Europe. Andrea del Sarto’s\\n  <i\\n    ><a\\n      href=\\\"http://www.travelingintuscany.com/images/art/andreadelsarto/triumphofcaesar700.jpg\\\"\\n      target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n      >Triumph of Caesar</a\\n    ></i\\n  >\\n  employs multiple parrot species to depict this idea.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_lipsman_edn23\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_lipsman_ednref23\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[23]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  Two of the parrot types can be identified with confidence: the African Gray\\n  Parrots and Ring-Necked Parakeets inside the cage. The bird perched atop the\\n  cage may be a Red and Green Macaw from South America or a Crimson Shining\\n  Parrot from Fiji. Trade routes from the time make both birds possibilities.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_lipsman_edn24\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_lipsman_ednref24\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[24]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  While the body markings and beak size of del Sarto’s red bird have more in\\n  common with the Fijian parrot, the bird’s apparent overbite, where the top\\n  portion of the beak extends far over the bottom and white spot around the eye\\n  indicate that it is meant to be a Red and Green Macaw. With the understanding\\n  that this 16<sup>th</sup>century painting depicts Caesar receiving tribute\\n  from the farthest reaches of his empire, it would make more sense for the\\n  parrots to represent all directions in which the species was found, rather\\n  than just the lands immediately to the south and east of Europe.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_lipsman_edn25\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_lipsman_ednref25\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[25]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  Though the Roman Empire did not reach all the way to the Americas, del Sarto’s\\n  world had just expanded to encompass new lands as the Roman world expanded\\n  with each successful conquest. The inclusion of what we now know to be an\\n  American bird is also a reference to the newly extended reach of contemporary\\n  European empires.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Prior to the exploration of the New World, parrots signaled that a scene took\\n  place in either Paradise or a heavenly realm. As the number of voyages\\n  increased between Europe and the Americas, a trade in exotic birds turned the\\n  parrot into a multivalent symbol. They represented the Americas and the\\n  vastness of the globe. They also came to acquire another meaning. Because\\n  parrots could be taught to imitate human speech, they were seen as a metaphor\\n  for the artist’s mimicry of life. Peter Paul Rubens played with these new\\n  meanings in addition to the bird’s traditionally religious meanings in his\\n  various depictions of parrots. His circa 1628\\n  <i\\n    ><a\\n      href=\\\"https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/art-work/adam-and-eve/de0047db-6f8b-4761-a55b-ad41e959cca2\\\"\\n      target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n      >Adam and Eve</a\\n    ></i\\n  >\\n  is an almost direct copy of\\n  <a\\n    href=\\\"https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/art-work/adam-and-eve/e0ca4331-fb89-47a7-9ba0-be0ece23426b\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    >Titian’s <i>Adam and Eve</i></a\\n  >\\n  from about eighty years earlier.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_lipsman_edn26\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_lipsman_ednref26\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[26]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  The key difference between the two is that Rubens has added a macaw in the\\n  tree branch over Adam’s shoulder. The placement of Adam and the parrot on the\\n  same side of the painting as well as their spatial relationship, with the bird\\n  over his shoulder, are reminiscent of Dürer’s <i>Adam and Eve</i> engraving\\n  discussed above. Because it was now understood that Eden was not likely to be\\n  in the New World, parrots were not often used as a symbol of Eden.  They were,\\n  however, still a species that could place a scene in a faraway place. Because\\n  Rubens adds the macaw to an existing composition, he is amalgamating two\\n  artists’ works in one painting.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_lipsman_edn27\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_lipsman_ednref27\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[27]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  Irma Jaffe proposes that between the old belief that Paradise was in the\\n  Americas and the fact that Ruben’s access to macaws was a likely result of\\n  painting this work in Spain, the parrot may also refer to Spanish holdings in\\n  America. Rubens would have seen Titian’s original <i>Adam and Eve</i> in the\\n  Spanish Royal collections, where it resided at the time. The parrot is a nod\\n  to the traditional interpretations of parrots in art, a double reference to\\n  Titian and Dürer , and an allusion to the power and reach of the Spanish\\n  throne.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The <i>Adam and Eve</i> was not the first time Rubens had included a parrot in\\n  a religious scene. His 1613-1615 work,\\n  <i\\n    ><a\\n      href=\\\"https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/the-holy-family-with-the-parrot/ogEkvf1C1th7Rg\\\"\\n      target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n      >The Holy Family with a Parrot</a\\n    ></i\\n  >\\n  includes a Blue and Yellow Macaw perched on a column base behind Christ.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_lipsman_edn28\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_lipsman_ednref28\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[28]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  The spatial relationship between Christ and the parrot is the same as that\\n  between Adam and his respective bird. Both macaws rest on a surface just over\\n  the shoulder of the figure below them. In <i>Adam and Eve</i>, the parrot\\n  passively watches the scene unfold.  In <i>The Holy Family with a Parrot</i>,\\n  it ignores the family and turns its attention to the vine grasped in its beak.\\n  This scene goes back to the association of Mary and Christ serving as the new\\n  Adam and Eve. Like van Eyck’s\\n  <i>Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele , </i>the parrot makes the viewer\\n  think of Eden and the original sin from which the mother and Son serve as\\n  redemption.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Rubens’ depiction of Mary, Joseph, and Christ is one of the few examples of\\n  the Virgin and Child with a parrot that is not a copy or partial copy of van\\n  Eyck’s work<i>.</i> The fact that it comes 200 years after van Eyck’s painting\\n  shows that a connection between parrots and religious imagery remains in some\\n  form. The link in Rubens’s work may simply be that the association of parrots\\n  with Christian themes has become traditional through repetition. With too much\\n  diversity in its employment to constitute any one image type, the parrot\\n  becomes a motif of Adam and Eve and the newer, redemptive pair, Mary and\\n  Christ. A multifaceted symbol in Rubens’ <i>The Holy Family with a Parrot</i>,\\n  the bird works with the Oriental rug folded up directly below it to place the\\n  scene somewhere outside of Europe.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  As Europeans developed a concept of America as separate from Asia, the parrot\\n  came to symbolize the Americas in the west more than Asia in the east. This\\n  painting shows that the memory of parrots representing the East and the exotic\\n  survived into the 17th century and reminds us of Europe’s earlier association\\n  of America and Asia. By employing an American bird in an Eastern scene, Rubens\\n  depicts parrot species as interchangeable with one another across a range\\n  extending from America to Asia.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_lipsman_edn29\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_lipsman_ednref29\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[29]</sup></a\\n  >\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Bruce Boehrer points out that Rubens paints parrots as both objects in a scene\\n  and as their own living beings. This is evident in the number of paintings\\n  that show different parrot species, including a portrait of a Scarlet Macaw\\n  from the 1630’s simply titled\\n  <i\\n    ><a\\n      href=\\\"http://www.artandarchitecture.org.uk/images/gallery/d8488ed8.html\\\"\\n      target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n      >Parrot</a\\n    ></i\\n  >\\n  <i\\n    >.<a href=\\\"#_lipsman_edn30\\\" name=\\\"_lipsman_ednref30\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n      <b><sup>[30]</sup></b>\\n    </a></i\\n  >\\n  In this painting, the carefully rendered bird is the only living thing. Like\\n  many subjects of human portraits, it sits very still. A mountainous landscape\\n  stretches out behind it. At this point in history, the landscape may represent\\n  Europe instead of the parrot’s native territory.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  By the 1520’s, parrots had become so popular in Spain that explorers no longer\\n  felt the need to include them in their listings of American species. When\\n  writing about the animals of the “New World” in 1526, Gonzálo Fernandez de\\n  Oviedo does not mention parrots at all. He glosses over their exclusion by\\n  explaining that it is a waste of time and writing space to discuss species\\n  that are already readily available in Spain.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_lipsman_edn31\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_lipsman_ednref31\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[31]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  There is archaeological evidence to support this widespread trade in exotic\\n  birds. Two parrot bones dated to the 17<sup>th</sup>century were found at\\n  Norwich’s Castle Mall, which was certainly not a hub of cosmopolitan activity\\n  at the time.\\n  <a href=\\\"#_lipsman_edn32\\\" name=\\\"_lipsman_ednref32\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[32]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  The number of macaw species represented by Rubens and the increasing\\n  representations of parrots through the 17<sup>th</sup>century are both\\n  indicators of the booming market for exotic birds.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The parrot trade developed hybrid species of macaws. In Ruben’s 1635\\n  <i\\n    ><a\\n      href=\\\"https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/rubens-his-wife-helena-fourment-1614%E2%80%931673-and-their-son-frans-1633%E2%80%931678/xgFC_TOdAAR2nQ\\\"\\n      target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n      >Rubens, His wife Helena Fourment , and Their Son Frans</a\\n    ></i\\n  >\\n  , we find another one of his macaws. This one, however, is not as easily\\n  identified as the ones examined thus far.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_lipsman_edn33\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_lipsman_ednref33\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[33]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  This bird appears to be a hybrid species, a phenomenon that is not known to\\n  occur in the wild. Today, the crossbreed is known as a Harlequin Macaw,\\n  resulting from a pairing of a Red and Green Macaw with a Blue and Gold\\n  Macaw.<a href=\\\"#_lipsman_edn34\\\" name=\\\"_lipsman_ednref34\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[34]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  The presence of this bird in a 17<sup>th</sup>century painting can mean one of\\n  two things. The first, is that a male and female of the species in question\\n  were simply kept in a cage together and happened to mate. The second\\n  possibility is that the hybrid was bred intentionally. It is impossible to\\n  know how exactly this particular bird came to be, but both situations would be\\n  the direct result of the parrot trade and the unnatural groupings in which the\\n  birds were kept. Surely once bird merchants were aware that macaws of\\n  different subspecies could breed with one another to create unique color\\n  patterns, they would begin to use this to increase their birds sales. Being a\\n  family portrait, the inclusion of a bird with out-of-the-ordinary parentage\\n  can be read as a reference to procreation. If the bird was bred intentionally,\\n  it may also be a reference to the careful selection of a spouse and subsequent\\n  courtship its human contemporaries practiced.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  By examining parrots, we see how Europeans assimilated the new variety of\\n  birds into their existing notions of Paradise and the associated iconography.\\n  As they explored the region and better understood its geography, parrots came\\n  to symbolize the Americas and the expansion of Europe’s interactivity with the\\n  world. Finally, parrots came to gain their own meaning to Europeans,\\n  independent of their Amerasian origins. Boehrer notes how the increasing\\n  appearance of parrots in still lives through the 17<sup>th</sup>century\\n  demonstrates their fall in status. Prior to 1492, they had served as angelic\\n  messengers to men but by the 1600s they had become traded commodities.\\n</p>\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n<h3>Works Cited</h3>\\n<p>\\n  Boehrer , Bruce Thomas.\\n  <i\\n    >Parrot Culture: Our 2,500-Year-Long Fascination with the World’s Most\\n    Talkative Bird.</i\\n  >\\n  Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2010.

One set, indeed\\n  depicted over modern-day Senegal, are entirely green. Without the yellow sides\\n  and gray heads, they look less like Senegal Parrots and more like Ring-Necked\\n  Parakeets, also native to this part of Africa. The second set of parrots are\\n  shown over modern-day Nigera and Cameroon. These birds must be African Gray\\n  Parrots as they are native to this region and are accurately depicted by\\n  Cantino.

The monkeys in this\\n  painting are unidentified, but their locations within the overall composition\\n  are worth noting. A blonde white-faced monkey rides on a man’s shoulders just\\n  left of the painting’s center as they ascend the stairs. A white- and\\n  red-haired, black-faced monkey sits on the steps to the right, across an empty\\n  space left in just below the middle of the fresco. They seem to look at each\\n  other. The black-faced monkey is dressed in a tunic while the blonde one is\\n  naked. They appear to be intentionally opposed to one another. George argues\\n  that Europeans would have understood that the “New World” monkeys of America\\n  were different from the “Old World” monkeys they were familiar with in Asia\\n  and Africa (the terms New World and Old World are used here as the taxonomic\\n  designations set by the scientific community). A key morphological and\\n  behavioral difference between the monkeys of these regions becomes obvious\\n  after observation. New World monkeys have prehensile tails that they use to\\n  climb and grasp while Old World monkeys do not. Neither of the monkeys in this\\n  painting use their tails, but the contrast of clothed and nudity in\\n  conjunction with the space left between them leads me to believe that they are\\n  meant to represent the distance between what was familiar to Europe and what\\n  was new to them.

Claudius Ptolemy had supplied\\n  some of these, and others were supplied by his commentator Johannes Werner.\\n  Indeed, I took note that Claudius Ptolemy had taught that the ratio of the\\n  whole latitude to the whole longitude must be maintained not only in the\\n  parallel which should be drawn through Rhodes or Thule, but clearly in all of\\n  them. Knowing this ratio, a great deal of related things that had previously\\n  been obscure became clear to me, and this specification was among them. Once I\\n  had produced copious examples for friends, they urged me,&nbsp;almost daily,\\n  to publish them and to promise that I would not hesitate to gratify their\\n  wishes, should more certain information about the westerly lands reach me. As\\n  the unconquerable Charles the Fifth, Emperor of Rome, forever Augustus, was\\n  returning to Cologne, I was wisely striking up a friendship with the\\n  Castilians well-known for their substantial expertise, who among others were\\n  reporting that Baccalaria, Florida, New Spain, and America have boundaries\\n  joined with the eastern edges in this hemisphere. Moreover, none of these\\n  [Castilians] were able to speak soundly about the matter except for the\\n  Emperor, to whom day in and day out they sent back stories from New Spain,\\n  speaking in this way about newly discovered scattered islands.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n  But then, since it came into consideration (for I had also decided to discuss\\n  this matter with his Imperial Majesty ), as I was convening with his Imperial\\n  Majesty when investigating these facts, mention was made about these lands\\n  recently discussed, and in the midst of this his Imperial Majesty responded\\n  that those aforementioned countries were in no way separated by the interval\\n  of a sea, but rather connected to the eastern countries. He continued, saying\\n  that earlier the Spaniards had again and again gone west exploring from\\n  Tenochtitlan, the famous city of the Great Khan, also called Montezuma, and\\n  had not been able to find for him an end to the huge land. This would be\\n  sufficient proof that the western country reaches to the Chinese region and to\\n  the people of China, and make it certain that they belong in the sphere of the\\n  Castilians. This information he had received from Indians who had fought in\\n  wars with the unconquerable Ferdinand Cortes in New Spain.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  I would have quoted more of this statement here, but not for the fact that the\\n  book on Cosmography will have a passage about such things when it is\\n  eventually brought out, everything, therefore dear reader, that was\\n  communicated to me by his Imperial Majesty, and I wish for it to be\\n  communicated to you as it was spoken thus.  I offer this upon my arms, and in\\n  the meantime it will be of use to you, as you receive it from the mind that\\n  was my own source. Furthermore, if you do not delight in these first\\n  iterations, then I will publish another drawing depicting a cordiform map.\\n  <a name=\\\"_anchor_1\\\" href=\\\"#_msocom_1\\\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>\\n</p>\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n<p>\\n  <a href=\\\"#_moscom_1\\\" name=\\\"_anchor_1\\\" title=\\\"\\\"> [1] </a>Cordis humani efigiem:\\n  a likeness of a human heart.\\n</p>\\n\";","module.exports = \"<h1>Cartouche on Magellan: Transcription and Translation</h1>\\n<h2>Michael Agnew and Gabrielle Roehr</h2>\\n<p>\\n  Non temere me facturum existimo: si clari uiri aeterna memoria celebrandi\\n  Fer/di <i>nandi </i> Magelani [<i>sic</i>] cursum paucis indicarem.

For many years this man, the commander of the ships of Portugal, had\\n  traversed the shores of the entire East, and, having crossed the limits of\\n  Portuguese territories, he had made trade with the peoples of China, who—he\\n  was demonstrating and reporting—belonged to the territory of the Castilians.\\n  On account of these injustices inflicted upon him by the king of Portugal, he\\n  retreated into Castile. By far the most certain conclusion to be inferred is\\n  that it is to be believed that the Moluccas, filled with types of every spice,\\n  are contained within the limits of the Castilians. The Unconquerable Caesar\\n  provided a fleet of five ships, and Magellan was placed in command as the\\n  leader of these. Then, Magellan set sail with the five ships from Seville on\\n  August 10, 1519, and within a few days arrived at the Fortunate Isles [the\\n  Canaries, see on map “FORTUNAta insulae ”]. From there, to the Hesperides\\n  [Cape Verde, see on map “Hesperidum insulae ”], from which they began their\\n  journey to America, [where] they discovered a promontory, the name for which\\n  is Santa Maria [see on map “C. S. Mariae promontorio dive virginis ”]. From\\n  there, at the end of March of the following year, they were carried down to\\n  the port of Saint Julian [on map “P. Iuliani”], where they were suffering an\\n  especially bitter winter in May; and indeed, now in our summer, there one must\\n  suffer winter. From there, setting sail again on August 24, they arrived at\\n  the Province of the Cross on November 26 [see map, “C. Crucis”]. When that\\n  place had been abandoned and the narrow sea crossed, they came to the\\n  Unfortunate Isles [see map, just north of the Tropic of Capricorn “Insule\\n  infortunatae ”]. Then, after four months, they came to Inuagana [on map, near\\n  the figure of Magellan, “Inuagana”], and from there to the Moluccas [on map,\\n  just north of the equator, “Moluccae insulae ”], where they loaded the ships\\n  with cloves. Then, when the Spaniards had set sail from Tidore [on map, “Mare\\n  Theodore ”] through the deep Indian Ocean, giving their sails to the wind once\\n  they had navigated past the Cape of Good Hope, they arrived again in Spain on\\n  September 6, 1522, at the nearby port of Seville.\\n</p>\\n\";","module.exports = \"<h1>Cartouche on America/Vespucci: Transcription and Translation</h1>\\n<h2>Michael Agnew and Gabrielle Roehr</h2>\\n<p>\\n  America quam Americus Vesputius Nouum orbem Continentem quam/ terram\\n  nuncupauit, ab Americo Vesputio eiusdem inuentore nomen for-/tita Castellani\\n  uero modo Terram firmam uocant, &amp; ob id non immeri-/to nunc Quarta pars\\n  terrę dicta is ultra ęquatorem, ubi conspicatus gen-/tem mores, humanitatem,\\n  soli feracitatem, aeris temperiem, salubrita-/temque coeli; nactum se esse\\n  testatur cultiores regiones, easdemque habi-/tatoribus frequentiores, quam\\n  alibi gentium usquam, si Asiam, si Euro-/pam, Africamque spectaueris\\n  &amp;c<i>etera</i>.

The\\n  lifestyle of the people of the New World, first encountered by Europeans on\\n  the cusp of the sixteenth century, was a lightning rod for the European\\n  imagination. Seen as simultaneously idyllic and irrational, hedonistic and\\n  na•ve, the intellectual and creative minds of the period grappled with the\\n  geographical, philosophical, social, and spiritual character of these people,\\n  through both word and image. Conceived some forty years before Vopel voiced\\n  his own such fascination on the cartographic plane, Sir Thomas More's\\n  apocryphal <i>Utopia </i>blended fact and fiction, satire and sermon, to\\n  create a New World account that coyly straddles the boundaries between\\n  plausible travel testimony, absurd moral fantasy, and political treatise.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The story, written as an audience between More, fellow real-life humanist\\n  Peter Giles and fictional character Raphael Hythlodaeus Organized into a\\n  two-book structure, Hythlodaeus first expounds on a critique of the inequity\\n  of European&#8211;predominantly English&#8211;society, and then offers a\\n  description of the island commonwealth of Utopia as a moralizing\\n  counterexample. According to his account, after staying behind with a\\n  contingent from Amerigo Vespucci's fourth voyage in the New World and\\n  traveling westward through diversely peopled lands, Hythlodaeus came upon\\n  Utopia, an island society with a sophisticated political, economic, and social\\n  system based around communitarian principles: property in common, a disdain\\n  for gold and precious stones, religious tolerance, pacifism; equal\\n  distribution of labor, and a strict penal system. First published in 1516,\\n  <i>Utopia'</i>s New World setting has been the subject of scrutiny as\\n  centuries of Morean scholars have attempted to untangle its course among the\\n  many philosophical threads woven into this improbable tale.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  While the references, both direct and indirect, to the details of Vespucci's\\n  letters (see Weitzman essay on Buti frescoes and Vespucci) are clear in the\\n  text, there has nonetheless been much debate about the extent to which\\n  accounts of transatlantic exploration shaped the overall content and motifs of\\n  <i>Utopia. </i>One argument is that More's vision of a peaceful, orderly\\n  commonwealth is far too estranged from Vespucci's description of naked,\\n  uncouth, and sometimes violent New World natives, and so this inspiration must\\n  have been incidental at best.<a href=\\\"#_edn1\\\" name=\\\"_ednref1\\\">[1]</a> Many\\n  scholars note that a clear emphasis on Greek culture and philosophy points to\\n  ancient authors such as Plato, Homer, and Lucian as More's primary influences,\\n  rather than any contemporary writing.<a href=\\\"#_edn2\\\" name=\\\"_ednref2\\\">[2]</a>\\n  More certainly strove to promote ancient philosophy as a guiding principle for\\n  scholarly thought and rhetoric, and his circle particularly privileged Greek\\n  writing and philosophy over Roman.<a href=\\\"#_edn3\\\" name=\\\"_ednref3\\\">[3]</a> As\\n  a noted Greek and Latin scholar, More was better known for his translation of\\n  Lucian than the text of <i>Utopia.</i\\n  ><a href=\\\"#_edn4\\\" name=\\\"_ednref4\\\">[4]</a> However, these superficial\\n  incompatibilities with the worldly concerns of explorers' accounts do not\\n  preclude the importance of the New World as both a physical and conceptual\\n  setting for the Utopians. Rather, More's text often dramatizes the ways in\\n  which accounts from the New World were fitted into existing paradigms of\\n  geography and world history derived from antique models.\\n  <i>Utopia </i>repeatedly reveals and develops these paradigms to exploit the\\n  shifting terrain of new geographical discoveries.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Initially published in Leuven in Latin, several editions of <i>Utopia</i> were\\n  printed in More's lifetime accompanied by a group of appendices that\\n  reinforced the false authenticity of Hythlodaeus's story. The text is\\n  introduced as a true account related in person to More in the company of Peter\\n  Giles. Their mutual friend Erasmus of Rotterdam helped gather letters from\\n  accomplished scholars from their circle to preface the book along with a\\n  <a\\n    href=\\\"https://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/.a/6a00d8341c464853ef01b7c863db20970b-popup\\\"\\n    >map of the island </a\\n  >(the original designer of which is unknown) and a poem by the supposed poet\\n  laureate of Utopia with a Utopian-to-Latin translation. In the second edition\\n  of 1518, this map was\\n  <a href=\\\"https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:11177599\\\"\\n    >updated by Ambrosius Holbein</a\\n  >, who also provided an\\n  <a\\n    href=\\\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1441851&amp;partId=1&amp;people=82427&amp;peoA=82427-1-2&amp;page=1\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    >illustration of Hythlodaeus</a\\n  >\\n  in audience with More and Giles. The various letters that accompanied the\\n  text&#8211; from Giles to Hieronymus van Busleyden, from More to Giles; from\\n  Erasmus to printer Johann Froben, and later from Parisian scholar Gillaume\\n  BudŽ to Thomas Lupset in the 1518 edition&#8211; all refer to the content of\\n  the book as though it were fact, adding to the illusion of truth. The most\\n  compelling component of the ruse, however, is the text's references to the\\n  widely published letters of Amerigo Vespucci.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  <i>Utopia</i> was written approximately eleven years after Vespucci's letter\\n  to Piero Soderini describing his four journeys was first published in Florence\\n  circa 1505-1506 under the title\\n  <i\\n    >Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci delle isole nuovamente trovate in quatro suoi\\n    viaggi</i\\n  >. The following year, Martin WaldseemŸller published his historic\\n  <a href=\\\"https://www.loc.gov/item/2003626426/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    >Universalis Cosmographia</a\\n  >\\n  map depicting an insular western Atlantic landmass titled ÒAmericaÓ for the\\n  first time, in honor of Vespucci. A Latin translation of the\\n  <i>Lettera</i> was included in the map's accompanying treatise, the\\n  <i>Cosmographiae Introductio</i>, and several historians have made compelling\\n  arguments that it is this version of Vespucci's letter that More accessed.\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn5\\\" name=\\\"_ednref5\\\">[5]</a> The letter's denouement of the fourth\\n  voyage serves as the point of departure for Hythlodaeus's account, creating a\\n  deliberate air of factual continuity. As Vespucci reaches the conclusion of\\n  his letter to Piero Soderini, he states:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n  Having done all this, we decided to return to Portugal, which was on a course\\n  northeast by north; we left behind twenty-four men to remain in the fort,\\n  supplies for six months, twelve mortars and many other weapons; and we\\n  pacified all the people of that land, of whom no mention has been made for\\n  this voyage, but not because we did not see and have dealings with countless\\n  people there: for thirty of our men went forty leagues inland, where I myself\\n  saw so many things I must delay relating, saving them for my\\n  <i>Four Journeys.</i> <a href=\\\"#_edn6\\\" name=\\\"_ednref6\\\">[6]</a>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>\\n  This intriguingly open-ended description provided an aperture for More to\\n  insert his character's account into a record that was still under scrutiny.\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn7\\\" name=\\\"_ednref7\\\">[7]</a> In the opening pages of\\n  <i>Utopia</i>, Giles introduces Hythlodaeus to More, making direct reference\\n  to both Vespucci's exact words:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n  He went everywhere with [Amerigo Vespucci] throughout the last three of his\\n  four voyages- the ones that everyone is now reading about. Except, on the last\\n  voyage, he did not come home with him. He begged and even threatened Amerigo\\n  until he agreed to let hims stay behind as one of the twenty-four who were to\\n  be left garrisoning a fort at the furthest point to which their journey had\\n  taken them. <a href=\\\"#_edn8\\\" name=\\\"_ednref8\\\">[8]</a>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>\\n  Other continuities with Vespucci's letters became interpretive in their\\n  descriptions of the peoples and environs of newly discovered territories. In\\n  some attempts to reconcile discrepancy between More's highly civilized (by\\n  European standards) Utopians and Vespucci's descriptions of New World natives\\n  that range from the na•ve to the monstrous, there is debate that the form of\\n  the Utopian commonwealth draws on Vespucci's choice of classicizing terms for\\n  what he viewed as an essentially primitive society. In particular, amidst\\n  stories of cannibalism, lascivious sexual practices, murder, and na•vetŽ (some\\n  of which was illustrated in no uncertain terms in\\n  <a\\n    href=\\\"https://static.cambridge.org/resource/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20170127070941765-0481:9781139568128:03667fig3_3.png\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    >woodcuts</a\\n  >\\n  by\\n  <a\\n    href=\\\"https://static.cambridge.org/resource/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20170127070941765-0481:9781139568128:03667fig3_4.png\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    >Johannes GrŸninger</a\\n  >\\n  that accompanied the 1509 German edition of the <i>Lettera</i> he nonetheless\\n  describes the new territories as a paradise and the people within them as\\n  ÒEpicurean.Ó A particular passage of interest occurs in a fragmentary letter\\n  by Vespucci referred to as the ÒRidolfi FragmentÓ:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n  Éthose inhabitants prize neither gold nor other riches which we value and hold\\n  in great esteem, arguing that contrary to this we said we bought slaves from\\n  themÉ. for, as I said their life is rather more Epicurean than Stoic or\\n  Academic, because, as I state, they hold no private property, nor have they\\n  divisions into kingdoms or provinces: in conclusion, all that they have they\\n  hold in commonÉ<a href=\\\"#_edn9\\\" name=\\\"_ednref9\\\">[9]</a>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>\\n  Later in his letter to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de'Medici he states again that\\n  ÒThey live according to nature, and might be called Epicureans rather than\\n  Stoics.Ó <a href=\\\"#_edn10\\\" name=\\\"_ednref10\\\">[10]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  While this term is far gentler than some of the more barbaric\\n  characterizations of indigenous people, it neatly encapsulates a number of\\n  Vespucci's observations: that these people were pleasure-seeking,\\n  non-Christian, and living in a state of prelapsarian na•vetŽ for which an\\n  idyllic antiquity provided a convenient model. Thomas More liberally expands\\n  this construct beginning with Utopians' philosophy of pleasure, their primary\\n  ethic of happiness, stating:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n  They discuss virtue and pleasure, but their main topic of debate, their\\n  primary concern, is the understanding of human happinessÉ they hold that its\\n  happiness cannot be identified with pleasure, then at least pleasure is the\\n  main factor that makes for happinessÉ<a href=\\\"#_edn11\\\" name=\\\"_ednref11\\\"\\n    >[11]</a\\n  >\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>\\n  He further applies an Epicurean model in his description of their legal and\\n  penal systems. The harsh consequences for lawbreakers&#8211;slavery, exile or\\n  death&#8211; rely on a universal and idealistic ethic of civic obligation\\n  where social accountability and self-interest are intertwined.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Vespucci's letters may have left an opening for a Classical or Hellenistic\\n  imaginary of a New World society, but his explicit references to antiquity are\\n  limited. Nevertheless, More adopts and develops this model in a way that\\n  transcends analogy, devising a literal Mediterranean origin for the people of\\n  Utopia:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n  According to their history books, they had no information whatever regarding\\n  our part of the world (they call us the Ultra-equatorials) before I made\\n  landfall there, with one exception. Twelve hundred years ago a ship, which had\\n  been blown off course by a storm, was wrecked on the island of Utopia. Some\\n  Romans and Egyptians were tossed onto the shore and remained on the island for\\n  the rest of their lives.<a href=\\\"#_edn12\\\" name=\\\"_ednref12\\\">[12]</a>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>\\n  A significant tool that More uses to forge this heritage is language and\\n  wordplay, noting the the Utopians' ease in developing proficiency in Greek in\\n  one passage <a href=\\\"#_edn13\\\" name=\\\"_ednref13\\\">[13]</a> and later explaining\\n  that the Utopians must be descended from the Greeks because their language is\\n  etymologically similar. <a href=\\\"#_edn14\\\" name=\\\"_ednref14\\\">[14]</a> This\\n  justifies the many Greek pun names for locations, demonyms, and characters\\n  that populate Utopia. Most significant among them is the name for Utopia\\n  itself, which elicits two simultaneous translations:\\n  Eutopia(&#949;&#965;&#964;&#959;¹ &#959;&#962;), meaning Ògood placeÓ, and\\n  Ou-topia (&#959;&#965;&#964;&#959;¹ &#959;&#962;), meaning Òno placeÓ. Raphael\\n  Hythlodaeus' name is a humorous compound of hythlo and daeus (&#948;&#945;\\n  &#953;&#969;&#957;, &#965;&#952;&#955;&#959;&#962;), meaning peddler or\\n  distributor of nonsense. These tongue-in-cheek epithets are found throughout,\\n  from the Utopian capital, <i>Amaurot</i> (&#945;&#956;&#945;\\n  &#965;&#961;&#959;&#962;, ÒUnknownÓ or ÒDarkÓ City), to a fictional society\\n  Hythlodaeus encountered in his travels through Persia called the Polylerites\\n  (¹ &#959;&#955;&#965;, &#955;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#962;, Òpeople of much\\n  nonsense.Ó) <a href=\\\"#_edn15\\\" name=\\\"_ednref15\\\">[15]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  These names are couched in a dry humor that hints at the murky authenticity of\\n  the account, but they also reflect the geographical ambiguity of the New World\\n  in European consciousness. The veracity of accounts from New World journeys\\n  did not go undisputed (even Vespucci's letters), and the understanding of the\\n  New World's spatial relationship to both Europe and known Asian territories\\n  evolved and was adapted throughout the 16th and 17th centuries in response to\\n  changing information. Historian Toby Lester has suggested that More's use of\\n  wordplay, particularly the double meaning of ÒUtopiaÓ, may have been directly\\n  inspired by WaldseemŸller's <i>Cosmographiae Introductio</i>, where writer\\n  Matthias Ringmann's historic choice to christen the New World ÒAmericaÓ may\\n  have employed the same logic of the Òno-placeÓ as clever subtext to its overt\\n  association with Amerigo Vespucci.\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn16\\\" name=\\\"_ednref16\\\">[16]</a> For Vespucci, the eastern edge of\\n  what is now called South America represented the confluence of paradise (link\\n  to DRACONIS entry), heathendom, and the far more mundane trading pathway to\\n  Malacca. <a href=\\\"#_edn17\\\" name=\\\"_ednref17\\\">[17]</a> For More, these\\n  overlapping identities spoke to a mythological reality.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  As part of his sleight-of-hand with the truth, Thomas More leaves the location\\n  of the island of Utopia to the imagination of the reader, stating in his\\n  preface letter to Peter Giles that he Òforgot to askÉ just where in the New\\n  World Utopia is to be found.Ó<a href=\\\"#_edn18\\\" name=\\\"_ednref18\\\">[18]</a>\\n  Keeping its location secret allowed it to reside in a liminal state where the\\n  mythical and the real coexist. Nonetheless he localizes Utopia using a\\n  <a\\n    href=\\\"http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/blogs/world-map-after-macrobius\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    >zonal model</a\\n  >\\n  of the earth. Unlike Vespucci, who refers to passing through the ÒtorridÓ\\n  equatorial zone only to refute its supposed hostility\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn19\\\" name=\\\"_ednref19\\\">[19]</a>, More refers implicitly to the\\n  zonal model and reinforces it through descriptions of the harsh equatorial\\n  landscape:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n  To be sure, south of the equator, and indeed on either side of it for almost\\n  as far as the sun is distant from the earth, there lie vast empty deserts,\\n  scorched by the perpetual heat. In every direction the view is gloomy and\\n  dismal. Nature is wild and uncultivated. There are savage beasts and dangerous\\n  serpents, and a few men who are no less savage and dangerous than the\\n  creatures they live among. But if you keep traveling, slowly nature becomes\\n  more friendly. The climate is less harsh, the sun less scorching, the\\n  creatures les predatory. At length you reach civilization again.Ó\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn20\\\" name=\\\"_ednref20\\\">[20]</a>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>\\n  Describing the journey through the torrid zone and beyond, More fills in the\\n  gaps between zonal geography and the Greek and New World imaginaries by\\n  describing the monsters found in the torrid zone in mythological terms:\\n  ÒScyllas, or rapacious Celaenos, or man-eating Laestrygonians, or other\\n  monsters just as remarkable.\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn21\\\" name=\\\"_ednref21\\\">[21]</a> Expressed in recognizable terms,\\n  the man-eating giants and sea serpents of Odysseus and the Amazons of Heracles\\n  neatly enjoin with reports of Patagonian giants, Amazons, and cannibals that\\n  populate literature and cartography charting the exploration of the New World,\\n  including the Vopel map.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The Utopians themselves also endorse, albeit obliquely, a zonal construct of\\n  the world. Despite having Òno information whatever regarding [Europe],Ó\\n  Hythlodaeus reports, Òthey call us the Ultra-equatorials.Ó\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn22\\\" name=\\\"_ednref22\\\">[22]</a> More does not expand on Utopian\\n  notions of ÒUltra-equatorialÓ geography, but paints an overall picture of a\\n  people with scientific and philosophical competence on par with the antique\\n  Mediterranean, particularly in Òmusic, logic, arithmetic, and geometry,Ó but\\n  astronomy above all else. <a href=\\\"#_edn23\\\" name=\\\"_ednref23\\\">[23]</a> The\\n  zonal model being based originally on Pythagorean constructs and having\\n  evolved through a series of ancient adaptations concluding in Macrobius,\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn24\\\" name=\\\"_ednref24\\\">[24]</a> it is reasonable for the reader to\\n  believe that the Utopians have come to parallel conclusions about the\\n  antipodes as the Europeans, and the reference to ÒUltra-equatorialsÓ posits\\n  the equator as the boundary for that reflection. Beyond that frontier, the\\n  residents of one side become both mirror and myth to the other, occupying\\n  antipodal temperate zones divided by the wasteland.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Guillaume BudŽ's letter to Thomas Lupset prefacing the 1518 edition of\\n  <i>Utopia</i> suggests a specific place that superimposes the mythical on the\\n  real:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n  [Utopia is] surely one of the Fortunate Isles, which may lie close to the\\n  Elysian Fields- Hythloday, as More himself says, has not yet told us exactly\\n  where it is locatedÉ a community comfortable with its own customs and\\n  possessions, blessed with innocence and leading what we might call a heavenly\\n  life- Utopia is not in heaven, it is true, but it is certainly far superior to\\n  the muck that pervades the known worldÉUtopia, an island in the New WorldÉ<a\\n    href=\\\"#_edn25\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_ednref25\\\"\\n    >[25]</a\\n  >\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>\\n  This may be adapted from Vespucci, who no less than three times in his letters\\n  refers to the ÒFortunate islesÓ as a key portal through which he passed toward\\n  the New World, though in his case he clarifies it as another name for the\\n  Canary Islands. <a href=\\\"#_edn26\\\" name=\\\"_ednref26\\\">[26]</a> BudŽ's letter\\n  appears to refer, along with Elysium, to the lands of the virtuous dead of\\n  Greece, evoking the image of a classical paradise beyond the eastern horizon.\\n  Here too, as with Epicureanism, Vespucci's casual antique analogy becomes a\\n  defining model for the New World of Utopia.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  BudŽ's mythological localization coincides with or perhaps prefigures the\\n  thinking of several key writers on the New World, specifically BartolomŽ de\\n  las Casas whose <i>Historia de Las Indias</i> (1527) hypothesizes that Plato's\\n  Atlantis was not a fable but a reality proven by the existence of the New\\n  World, a massive continent west of the mouth of the Strait of Gibraltar.\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn27\\\" name=\\\"_ednref27\\\">[27]</a> Gonzalo Fern‡ndez de Oviedo\\n  hypothesizes in his <i>La Historia general de las Indias</i> (1535) that the\\n  West Indies were actually the legendary Hesperides, island home of the\\n  demigoddess guardians of Atalanta's golden apples, which was also associated\\n  with the legendary Arcadia. <a href=\\\"#_edn28\\\" name=\\\"_ednref28\\\">[28]</a> The\\n  common location of these mythological analogues&#8211; Elysium, Fortunata,\\n  Atlantis, the Hesperides&#8211; beyond the western horizon of the\\n  Mediterranean creates a plausibility born of geographic consensus and\\n  convergence with the New World discoveries. In maps of the 16th century,\\n  including the 1520\\n  <a\\n    href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Sch%2525C3%2525B6ner_globe%2523/media/File:Sch%2525C3%2525B6ner_globe_1520_western_hemisphere.jpg\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    >Johannes Schšner Globe</a\\n  >, the 1540\\n  <a\\n    href=\\\"https://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/maps/websites/pacific/pacific-ocean/map-pacific-munster-1540.jpg\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    >Sebastian MŸnster map\\n  </a>\\n  and Caspar Vopel's, the Hesperides can be found in varying positions in the\\n  Atlantic ocean.

In Vopel's map\\n  this is expressed through the visual geographic continuity between an American\\n  and Asian landmass. In his letters Vespucci states clearly that he has\\n  travelled to the ÒIndian regionsÓ\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn29\\\" name=\\\"_ednref29\\\">[29]</a> in a quest for passage to\\n  Taprobane <a href=\\\"#_edn30\\\" name=\\\"_ednref30\\\">[30]</a> or Malacca,\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn31\\\" name=\\\"_ednref31\\\">[31]</a> and despite his overwhelming Greek\\n  modeling for <i>Utopia</i>, More did not neglect this crucial motivation; an\\n  Asian geographical identity is emphatically present. We know that Utopia must\\n  be located within proximity to the Indies, because as More tells us in his\\n  initial impressions of Hythlodaeus, that at the end of his sojourn in Utopia,\\n  ÒBy remarkable good luck he was on a ship that was driven by a storm to\\n  Ceylon, and from there he made his way to Calcutta.Ó\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn32\\\" name=\\\"_ednref32\\\">[32]</a> While this detail suggests\\n  proximity to the Indian subcontinent, a further clue&#8211; in Greek of\\n  course&#8211; also points to a convergence of the Utopian New World and India.\\n  In the\\n  <a href=\\\"https://www.rct.uk/collection/1086970/utopia\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    >Utopian cipher facing the frontispiece\\n  </a>\\n  of text, there is also a poem by the Utopian poet laureate Anemolius, which is\\n  transcribed and then translated into Latin at the bottom of the page. The word\\n  translated into Latin as ÒphilosopherÓ is phonetically transcribed from\\n  Utopian (supposedly evolved from Greek) as Ògymnosophaon,Ó a classical term\\n  that commonly referred to philosophers of India.\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn33\\\" name=\\\"_ednref33\\\">[33]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Lastly, there is a repeated motif of Persian proximity throughout\\n  <i>Utopia</i>. It begins with the Persia-adjacent land of the Polylerlites ,\\n  which Hythlodaeus cites in his Book One, and repeats in the language, history,\\n  and culture of Utopia: though Utopian retains Òtraces of GreekÓ, it Òresembles\\n  Persian in other respects.Ó In discussing the country's founder, Utopus,\\n  Hythlodaeus reveals that it was previously called Ò Abraxa,Ó\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn34\\\" name=\\\"_ednref34\\\">[34]</a> and he twice names ÒMithraÓ as the\\n  common name for god in an otherwise religiously heterogenous society.\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn35\\\" name=\\\"_ednref35\\\">[35]</a> This explicit Persian proximity is\\n  subtly enhanced by the invocation of near eastern gnosticism through Abraxas\\n  and the esoteric spiritual traditions of Mithraism but it also proposes a\\n  society with a composite culture that blends features of the familiar and\\n  foreign .The Utopians occupy a physical space that is just over the horizons,\\n  known but not seen, where the newly discovered extremes of east and west\\n  converge onto a unified identity.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Inevitably, this multivalent antique/Asian/American imaginary does not\\n  comprise a one-way trajectory for which <i>Utopia </i>merely bears witness. In\\n  what may be the only contemporary artistic reference to <i>Utopia</i> beyond\\n  the illustrations of the first and second editions, a curious print indicates\\n  the conflicting characterizations of the New World using <i>Utopia</i> as a\\n  pretext. The panoramic scene depicts a bloody battle between clothed and\\n  nearly naked men beneath the towering branches of a pine forest. The nude men\\n  have neither exoticizing costume beyond their nakedness nor distinctly\\n  non-European morphology, and in a\\n  <a\\n    href=\\\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/404505\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    >first state print of the woodcut\\n  </a>\\n  in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the only\\n  clearly identifying information is the woodcutter's mark. In a second state\\n  exhibited in Leuven in 2016, however, a poem has been added beneath the image\\n  that identifies the nude men as hailing from Utopia, Ônot far from Morian':\\n</p>\\n<blockquote>Ain Insel hai§t Utopion/ Die leyt nit ferr von Morian</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n  Da g[e] schach ain sollichs schlagen/ Hundert tausent hort ich sagen\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n  Doch ist es eben vil der Jar/ Das ich gelaub es sey nit war\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n  Wann wie wolt ain nackend man/ Ain angelegten pawren b[e] stanÉ\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn36\\\" name=\\\"_ednref36\\\">[36]</a>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>\\n  Perhaps the woodcutter is making an early reference to Morpion , a land later\\n  cited as existing a quarter league from the Rio de la Plata by Andr Ž Thevet\\n  in his travel account <i>Les singularitez de la France antarctique</i> (The\\n  New Found World, or Antarctike). He states the Spanish encountered wild men\\n  nearby <a href=\\\"#_edn37\\\" name=\\\"_ednref37\\\">[37]</a>; could these wild men be\\n  the woodcutter's Utopians? In any case, his connection to the milieu of\\n  <i>Utopia</i> is not arbitrary. Hans LŸtzelberger, identified by his monogram,\\n  was employed by More's Basel publisher Johann Froben , and worked with Hans\\n  Holbein the Younger, brother of More's 1518 illustrator Ambrosius Holbein in\\n  illustrating Reformation bibles and humanist tracts.\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn38\\\" name=\\\"_ednref38\\\">[38]</a> He may have been intimately\\n  familiar with the Utopian narrative and other contemporary travel accounts.\\n  The choice to depict More's sophisticated, peaceful Utopians as naked, warlike\\n  drunkards (a figure at the far left curiously holds a beer tankard) speaks to\\n  the text's involvement in an ongoing dialogue between reports of the New World\\n  and the paradigms projected onto it by the curious intellectual circles of\\n  Europe. LŸtzelberger's Utopians seem far closer to the people described in\\n  Oviedo's <i>Historia</i>, who find that the Ò idolatr’as y erroresÓ of the\\n  indigenous Americans echoed the paganism of antiquity in a Òreligion of the\\n  Devil.Ó <a href=\\\"#_edn39\\\" name=\\\"_ednref39\\\">[39]</a> The woodcutter's poem\\n  remains ambiguous, perhaps alluding to the questionable veracity of\\n  conflicting New World testimonies and their interpretations by skeptically\\n  dismissing eyewitnesses to his invented Utopian battle: ÒHundert tausent hort\\n  ich sagen/ Doch ist es eben vil der Jar/Das ich gelaub es sey nit warÓ states\\n  (in rough translation) that though Òa hundred thousand heard [the story] told/\\n  it was many years ago/ I don't believe it happened.Ó\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn40\\\" name=\\\"_ednref40\\\">[40]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Michel Foucault tells us that ÒUtopias are sites with no real place. They are\\n  sites that have a general relation of direct or inverted analogy with the real\\n  space of Society. They present society itself in a perfected form, or else\\n  society turned upside down, but in any case these utopias are fundamentally\\n  unreal spaces.Ó <a href=\\\"#_edn41\\\" name=\\\"_ednref41\\\">[41]</a> This may be a\\n  serious mischaracterization of Thomas More's <i>Utopia</i>. Its legacy has\\n  outgrown its original context to become the namesake of a vast\\n  cross-disciplinary genre of visionary worlds that quite often exist outside of\\n  physical space as Foucault suggests: projections of desire that passively\\n  represent an impossible ideal. But <i>Utopia </i>problematizes place and space\\n  in an inherently different way. More's utopia is full of improbable ideals and\\n  radical notions like any other, some that are shockingly revolutionary even to\\n  a 21st century reader. But the space it occupies, though unresolved, is real:\\n  the New World.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  This New World is not truly new; it is merely the unseen reaches of the Old\\n  World that have long existed over the horizon, now beginning to come into\\n  view. While his primary intention may be to promote the virtues of a society\\n  modeled on Greek philosophy rather than to discern the identity of new lands\\n  or attempt an anthropological portrait, the setting is key to rendering its\\n  improbability believable, appropriating the New World's inherent geographical,\\n  topological, and cultural mutability, already rich in contradiction and\\n  fantastical detail. He utilizes this manifold imaginary to disguise the\\n  fictitiousness of Hythlodaeus's account. The physical distance of America and\\n  the temporal distance of antiquity become analogous to one another, just as\\n  the north/south axis of the known-to-unknown becomes interchangeable with the\\n  axis of east to west and the Elysian fields converge with India; Hythlodaeus\\n  himself becomes an analogue for Ulysses and Vespucci simultaneously. Rather\\n  than occupying a Òfundamentally unreal space,Ó Utopia occupies a real space\\n  that simply has yet to be defined in fixed terms and so can realistically be\\n  all things at once. Unlike the utopias of Foucault, this space is not a\\n  passive mirror. It has its own evolving identity that reflects back, changing\\n  and influencing those working to define it.\\n</p>\\n<hr align=\\\"left\\\" size=\\\"1\\\" width=\\\"33%\\\" />\\n<div id=\\\"edn1\\\">\\n  <p class=\\\"Footnote\\\">\\n    <a href=\\\"#_ednref1\\\" name=\\\"_edn1\\\">[1]</a> Cave, Alfred A., ÒThomas More and\\n    the New World,Ó\\n    <i>Albion: A Quarterly Journal Concerned with British Studies </i>23, No. 2\\n    (Summer, 1991): 211-212.\\n  </p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\\\"edn2\\\">\\n  <p class=\\\"Footnote\\\">\\n    <a href=\\\"#_ednref2\\\" name=\\\"_edn2\\\">[2]</a> Raisch, Jane, ÒHumanism and\\n    Hellenism: Lucian and the Afterlives of Greek in More's UtopiaÓ,\\n    <i>ELH</i> 83, No. 4 (Winter 2016): 928-929.\\n  </p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\\\"edn3\\\">\\n  <p class=\\\"Footnote\\\">\\n    <a href=\\\"#_ednref3\\\" name=\\\"_edn3\\\"> [3] </a> Nelson, Eric, ÒUtopia through\\n    Italian Eyes: Thomas More and the Critics of Civic HumanismÓ,\\n    <i>Renaissance Quarterly</i> 59, No. 4 (Winter 2006): 1034.\\n  </p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\\\"edn4\\\">\\n  <p class=\\\"Footnote\\\">\\n    <a href=\\\"#_ednref4\\\" name=\\\"_edn4\\\">[4]</a> Raisch, Jane, ÒHumanism and\\n    HellenismÓ, 933.\\n  </p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\\\"edn5\\\">\\n  <p class=\\\"Footnote\\\">\\n    <a href=\\\"#_ednref5\\\" name=\\\"_edn5\\\">[5]</a> Du Verger, Jean, ÒGŽographie et\\n    Cartographie Fictionelles dans l'<i>Utopie </i>(1516) de Thomas MoreÓ,\\n    <i>Moreana</i> 47, no. 181-182, 9-68 and Lester, Toby,\\n    <i\\n      >The Fourth Part of the World: The Race to the Ends of the Earth and the\\n      Epic Story of the Map That Gave America its Name,</i\\n    >\\n    (London: Free Press, 2009) 377.\\n  </p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\\\"edn6\\\">\\n  <p class=\\\"Footnote\\\">\\n    <a href=\\\"#_ednref6\\\" name=\\\"_edn6\\\">[6]</a> Vespucci, Amerigo, ÒLetter to Piero\\n    SoderiniÓ in\\n    <i>Letters from a New World: Amerigo Vespucci's Discovery of America</i>,\\n    ed.

Lester argues for Ringmann as the author of the\\n    <i>Cosmographiae </i>in large part because of his unique interests and\\n    skillset as a Graecophile like More. In exploring the ways in which this\\n    manifests, Lester proposes a similar interest in wordplay that exploits the\\n    similarity between Vespucci's given name, Amerigo, and an array of Greek\\n    neologisms directly analogous to ÒUtopia.Ó On pages 356-358 he states ÒThe\\n    name may also contain a play on meros, a Greek word that can sometimes be\\n    translated as ÒplaceÓ. Here Amerigen becomes A-meri-gen, or ÒNo-place-landÓ:\\n    not a bad way to describe a previously unnamed continent whose geography is\\n    still uncertain,Ó and when commenting on the <i>Cosmographiae'</i>s\\n    influence on More on page 377, he observes, ÒThe name Utopia itself- a word\\n    coined by More from Greek roots to mean Òno-placeÓ (ou-topia), Ògood placeÓ\\n    (eu-topia), or both- bears an uncanny likeness to the name America. Both are\\n    three-syllable coinages derived from Greek, both identify a previously\\n    unknown region across the ocean and suggest it may be a kind of Nowhere Land\\n    (A-meri-gen, or Òno-place-land,Ó and ou-topia or Òno-placeÓ), and both\\n    involve a private play on words intended for a small audience of highly\\n    educated humanists.Ó\\n  </p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\\\"edn17\\\">\\n  <p class=\\\"Footnote\\\">\\n    <a href=\\\"#_ednref17\\\" name=\\\"_edn17\\\">[17]</a> Vespucci, Amerigo, ÒLetter VI to\\n    Piero Soderini (Quattro Viaggio)Ó in\\n    <i>Letters from a New World: Amerigo Vespucci's Discovery of America</i>,\\n    ed.

Francesco’s brother, Ferdinando I, who succeeded him as Duke of\\n  Tuscany, rushed to decorate the armory before his wedding to Christina of\\n  Lorraine. The room contained weapons and armor from around the world,\\n  including the New World and India, acquired by Francesco, an avid collector.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn1\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref1\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[1]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  In 1588, Medici court artist Ludovico Buti completed frescoes on the armory’s\\n  ceiling depicting four international battle scenes to accompany the weapons on\\n  display, now gallery room 20 in the Uffizi in Florence (<i>figure 1, 2</i>).\\n  The grotesque tracery design was common during this period, particularly for\\n  armory ceilings, but in this case bolsters the fantastic forms of New World\\n  discoveries.<a href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn2\\\" name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref2\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[2]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  Although exceedingly wealthy, the Medici did not have the financial\\n  wherewithal to fund their own New World expeditions. Because the room\\n  displayed the Medici arms collection and was considered a social space, it is\\n  likely that Ferdinando, as the new Duke, intended to utilize the room to\\n  project his family’s wealth and power to the wedding guests and other\\n  dignitaries. Ludovico Buti served these needs by presenting an amalgamation of\\n  New World cultures and conquests by utilizing prints, maps, and texts\\n  circulating within the Medici cultural milieu. While current scholarship has\\n  demonstrated that there are clear political agendas addressed in the armory’s\\n  imagery which align the family with Spain and Portugal, I argue that Buti’s\\n  intermix of disparate cultures also reveals the Medici considered New World\\n  objects to be only loosely separate from the Asian continent during the late\\n  Cinquecento. By interlacing the New World with India, the armory’s imagery\\n  reveals a court culture in which the definition of the Americas was still in\\n  flux. As such, the fresco reflects Francesco’s desire to have agency in New\\n  World discoveries, while simultaneously revealing a broader resistance to\\n  modifying the continent’s Ptolemaic, and thus anachronistic, connection to\\n  Asia.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The armory’s four battle scenes fan out from the center of the ceiling and\\n  depict conflicts between Western European armies and natives from America,\\n  Africa, and Asia. The scenes to the ceiling’s north and south feature imagery\\n  with clear cultural signifiers and some indication of geography, although it\\n  is not totally conclusive, whereas the east and west scenes are less\\n  straightforward. The battle located to the north (<i>figure 3</i>) depicts the\\n  Medici, as signified by the <i>palle</i> banner paraded on horseback,\\n  defeating the Turks in striped turbans who clamor up the side of a hill after\\n  dropping their crescent moon flag. The background is less clear as a\\n  nondescript maritime setting, which could depict the battle of Piombino, a\\n  crucial trade port developed by Ferdinando.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn3\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref3\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[3]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  Directly below the scene is a marginal rectangular gold box with tracery\\n  design containing two elephants and spiky palms. The opposite battle on the\\n  southern side of the ceiling (<i>figure 4</i>) could be a clash between the\\n  Spanish, as signified by the red and white standard,<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn4\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref4\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[4]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  and New World feathered natives, who defend themselves with spears and shields\\n  against the far superior European guns.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn5\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref5\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[5]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  The background is dotted with tropical foliage and arched huts cascading along\\n  rolling hills, and another small rectangular box is positioned below the scene\\n  containing a native standing contrapposto with a rhinoceros.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The scenes on the east and west ends of the ceiling are less detailed and more\\n  difficult to identify. Lia Markey argues the skin color, dress, and weaponry\\n  of the natives are evidence that the two scenes are battles between Turks and\\n  Africans (<i>figure 5</i>), and Islamic North Africa and the Portuguese (<i\\n    >figure 6</i\\n  >).<a href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn6\\\" name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref6\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[6]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  The Turks in the lower left corner of the African scene are identifiable based\\n  on their striped clothing and turbans. However, the identity of their\\n  opponents is not decidedly African. Given the figures are wearing loin cloths\\n  and carrying bows and swords, and the setting is mountainous and hilly, with\\n  tropical foliage containing low huts featured in Buti’s American battle\\n  between the Spanish, the sense of place is muddied and could also be\\n  identified as a New World setting. The battle between Islamic North Africa and\\n  the Portuguese is similarly convoluted.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The central <i>tondo </i>(<i>figure 7</i>) unites the four battle scenes and\\n  acts as a sharp foil to their frenetic energy and violence. It is idyllic,\\n  with tropical foliage and a hint of architecture in the background, devoid of\\n  both war and European figures. In the foreground, seven men wearing striped\\n  loin cloths and full feathered headdresses, carrying arrows and a parasol,\\n  parade a cloaked regal figure across the edge of the frame. The “chief”\\n  carries what appears to be a type of battle axe, which was likely similar to\\n  one on view in the armory. The parade of natives is a spectacle of mannered\\n  and classicizing poses, weapons, and display of exotica, which Peter Mason\\n  considers a hybrid assemblage of motifs that has moved away from ethnographic\\n  accuracy.<a href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn7\\\" name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref7\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[7]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  The headdressed natives set in an architectural tropical landscape are\\n  congruent with the inexact exotica in rest of the scenes. Who, and where, are\\n  these natives?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The ambiguous geographic locations and fluidity of iconographic signifiers in\\n  all four battle scenes bring to bear the scholarly problem of discerning how\\n  the Medici defined America and its natives, landmasses, and objects. The\\n  conflated idea of “Amerasia,” a term that refers to the amalgamation of\\n  America and Asia in sixteenth-century maps, imagery, and texts, is a problem\\n  circulating through current scholarly arguments with no resolution. In the\\n  case of Buti’s armory fresco, Amerasian imagery is present in the battle\\n  between the Medici and American natives, particularly in the rhinoceros below,\\n  and the central <i>tondo</i> in which architectural details, flora, and native\\n  dress blur demarcation between New World Americas and broadly southern Asian\\n  signifiers such as bananas,<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn8\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref8\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[8]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  a parasol, and the chief’s bier (a trope that will be examined later through\\n  circulating prints). In her seminal 2015 book\\n  <i>Imagining the Americas in Medici Florence</i>, Lia Markey argues that by\\n  using cultural generalizations to contextualize Medici weaponry, Buti’s\\n  ceiling is a theatrical performance of foreign natives whose ethnographic\\n  rendering was intended to demonstrate the weapons in use while also\\n  politically aligning the Medici with New World discoveries.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn9\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref9\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[9]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  Ultimately, Markey argues that Ferdinando was responding to Philip II, King of\\n  Spain, Portugal, and Sicily, who banned Amerasian imagery because of its\\n  blasphemous content. Ferdinando was careful not to undermine Philip’s desires\\n  because the Medici depended on Spain’s financial partnership.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn10\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref10\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[10]</sup></a\\n  >\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  However, with the problem of Amerasia in mind, additional connotations emerge\\n  from the frescoes’ details when considering contemporary costume books, texts,\\n  and maps that would have been familiar to the Medici court. Although the\\n  Medici likely viewed these lands as separate continents and conquests, they\\n  might also have conceptualized America and Asia as a region of the world where\\n  the East met the West. Thus, in utilizing ubiquitous reference materials\\n  present within the Medici milieu, the contemporary viewer might have\\n  understood the multifarious signifiers in Buti’s imagery as depicting a New\\n  World in close concert with India and Southeast Asia, as well as the Medici\\n  alignment to these conquests through collections and political alliances\\n  displayed prominently in the armory. There is little scholarship outside of\\n  Markey’s work that considers the social implications of Buti’s fresco. In\\n  addition to its theatricality and political implications, Buti’s iconography\\n  has an ideological demarcation that is worth investigating.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  At the intersection of Asian and New World iconography are ethnographic\\n  composites of disparate New World cultures. The mixing of New World societies\\n  through objects and depictions of its natives, particularly Aztec and\\n  Brazilian in this case, should be examined at the outset, because the larger\\n  issue of cultural overlap between Asia and New World imagery is partly rooted\\n  in an unclear definition of the word “Indian.”<b> </b>In 1588, when Ferdinando\\n  assumed responsibility for completing the armory decoration, the definition of\\n  terms such as “New World” and “Indian” were still decidedly fluid; “New World”\\n  could refer to newly discovered lands of both the east and west. (On the range\\n  of meanings of the word India and Indians,\\n  <a href=\\\"#riccio-india\\\">see the entry by Vittoria Riccio</a>.) Ferdinando’s\\n  collection inventories from c.1571 to 1588 use the terms <i>Indiana</i>,\\n  <i>alla Indiana</i>, and <i>dell</i><i>’</i><i>Indie </i>to define objects\\n  from the Americas, India, of Moorish origin, and Asia more generally.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn11\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref11\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[11]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  The word “Indian” itself is loaded and imprecise. Jessica Keating and Lia\\n  Markey’s research reveals that the term has often been taken for granted in\\n  current scholarly research, and could refer to anything that is of abundance,\\n  exotic, of a “foreign” style, or simply non-European.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn12\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref12\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[12]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  In order to create believable and verisimilar imagery of places and people\\n  neither Buti nor Francesco had ever seen firsthand, Buti borrowed from\\n  multiple sources that originated from both the broader continent of Europe and\\n  the New World, further augmenting the ambiguity of these terms.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Markey has already examined Bernardino de Sahagún’s c.1577\\n  <i>Florentine Codex—</i>an important source for Buti’s imagery that belonged\\n  to Ferdinando. The <i>Codex</i>, a three-volume illustrated manuscript,\\n  documents the lives of the Aztecs during the conquest of New Spain.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn13\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref13\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[13]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  It is considered to be one of the most thorough and important documents\\n  describing Aztec and Mexican culture and the flora of the region.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn14\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref14\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[14]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  (On the Florentine Codex owned by Ferdinando I de Medici,\\n  <a href=\\\"#raitt-florentinecodex\\\">see the entry by Louisa Raitt</a>.) Markey\\n  also demonstrates that Buti’s quotations range from codices to circulating\\n  Flemish, French, and German prints, further demonstrating his appropriation of\\n  a variety of sources for the armory ceiling imagery.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn15\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref15\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[15]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  Another possible influence on Buti’s imagery worth considering is the two\\n  Amerasian figures in Christopher Weiditz’s c.1530s <i>Trachtenbuch </i>(<i\\n    >figure 8</i\\n  >), an illustrated costume book that in itself carries further significance\\n  because of its commixture of native cultures. Although the\\n  <i>Trachtenbuch</i> was not widely circulated, Weiditz’s illustrations were\\n  disseminated separately as copies.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn16\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref16\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[16]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  The manuscript showcases contemporary dress belonging to varied social ranks\\n  including indigenous Aztecs. The natives’ loincloths and the blue and red\\n  bulky striped cape draped over the king in Buti’s center <i>tondo</i> are as\\n  close to Weiditz’s imagery as other scholarly comparisons to the<i> Codex</i>.\\n  Elizabeth Boone argues Weiditz’s images are more sartorial than accurate, as\\n  many of his drawings are glossed as Aztecs but dressed in Brazilian feathered\\n  skirts and headdresses—again, exoticizing the figures by converging\\n  ethnographic elements from a variety of sources.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn17\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref17\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[17]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  Buti’s own combination of the <i>Codex </i>and <i>Trachtenbuch </i>is thus a\\n  response to the larger pedagogical environment within the court driven by\\n  costume books and circulating prints.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn18\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref18\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[18]</sup></a\\n  >\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The influence of itinerant print materials on Ludovico Buti’s imagery also\\n  extended to widely circulated continental allegories. Coupled with the\\n  fluidity of regional definitions applied to Medici inventory, Giovanni\\n  Stradano’s c.1580s “Vespucci’s Voyage of Discovery” print from the\\n  <i>Americae Retectio </i>(<i>figure 9</i>), drawing from the legacy of Amerigo\\n  Vespucci and his ties to the Medici, provides additional information regarding\\n  how the Medici sought to project themselves and their view of the New World.\\n  Created in the Medici court during the time Ferdinando transitioned to Duke,\\n  Stradano celebrates Vespucci, who stands tall on his ship with his family coat\\n  of arms blowing in the wind, with the Spanish standard below. The city of\\n  Florence is represented by Mars riding a turtle pulled by lions, and Minerva\\n  to the lower right, with lilies symbolizing the Virgin of Florence.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn19\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref19\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[19]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  To the left of the broken mast is a fantastical figure in full feather\\n  headdress carrying a club and skewered human arm—an image in close concert\\n  with the headdresses of Buti’s natives, and one of few prints during the late\\n  Cinquecento that features large peacock-like plumes. Markey argues that\\n  Stradano was responding to imagery and accounts of New World native\\n  cannibalism and presents this native as a proud but demonic fantasy.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn20\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref20\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[20]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  Vespucci was a crucial figure for the Medici as secretary on a diplomatic\\n  mission to France, and later Spain. He represented Florence in New World\\n  expeditions, which was important to the Medici’s political prowess as they\\n  were not active participants in these voyages. The fixation on Vespucci and\\n  his alignment with the discovery of the New World is still evident in the\\n  creation of images like Stradano’s, and indicates a pervasive ideological\\n  attachment to his conquests.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn21\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref21\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[21]</sup></a\\n  >\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The full-plumed headdresses on Buti’s natives could be a quotation of\\n  Stradano’s allegory given their visual congruence, but, in turn, also a\\n  reference to Vespucci’s textual accounts of America. Vespucci embarked on four\\n  expeditions along the coasts of modern Brazil and Venezuela which he referred\\n  to in earlier letters as the “the south of Asia,” and in a second letter\\n  vaguely described a single land mass that was “not Asia.”<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn22\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref22\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[22]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  In Vespucci’s correspondence to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de’ Medici and\\n  Florentine statesman Piero Soderini, he refers repeatedly to the natives they\\n  encountered as nude and cannibalistic, white or red in complexion, and some\\n  bearing round shields, spears, and bows and arrows.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn23\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref23\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[23]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  Buti includes natives with variant complexions who carry spears and shields in\\n  the Spanish battle scene, and the plethora of parrots in the tracery also\\n  echoes Vespucci’s accounts of the variety of colorful birds he encountered.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn24\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref24\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[24]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  (On parrots, <a href=\\\"#lipsman-parrots\\\">see the entry by Claire Lipsman</a>)\\n  As Vespucci sailed far south along the coast of what is known as South America\\n  in search of gold, it is clear from his letters that he became more convinced\\n  they had embarked on new land rather than a continuation of the Asian\\n  continent.<a href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn25\\\" name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref25\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[25]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  His reports hinted at the possibility that Columbus’s Asiatic landmass was\\n  surrounded by two oceans—an inference which later became the first\\n  cartographic reference to the Pacific Ocean depicted by\\n  <a name=\\\"_Hlk532114433\\\">Martin Waldseemüller</a> (<i>figure 10</i>).<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn26\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref26\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[26]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  At the suggestion of Waldseemüller, the region was christened with Amerigo\\n  Vespucci’s namesake, which had deep connections to Florence, the Medici, and\\n  their court.<a href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn27\\\" name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref27\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[27]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  Coupled with Vespucci’s accounts, Stradano’s imagery and his ties to the court\\n  allowed the Medici some authorship in the phenomenon of the New World. In this\\n  respect, Stradano’s imagery carries particular resonance in the midst of\\n  hundreds of allegorical prints circulating during the period.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Although Waldseemüller’s c.1507 map demonstrates that Vespucci’s descriptions\\n  marked the beginning of a shift in the way the Americas were depicted as\\n  cartographically separate from Asia, it is not proof that the Medici’s own\\n  conceptualization of the Americas changed as quickly. Rather, while Brazilian\\n  iconography prevails in Buti’s Amerindian imagery as demonstrated by his\\n  quotation of Weiditz, as well as visual connections to Stradano’s courtly work\\n  and Vespucci’s Florentine legacy, Asian references in Ludovico Buti’s imagery\\n  are equally prevalent and significant. One probable connection to the Asian\\n  continent in Ludovico Buti’s armory ceiling is the convincingly rendered\\n  rhinoceros below the battle scene between New World natives and Spanish\\n  conquistadors (<i>figure 11</i>). The inclusion of the rhinoceros is not\\n  perfunctory. Buti also positions two elephants below the opposite Medici\\n  scene; because the Turks often used elephants in battle, the iconography is\\n  fitting in this particular context.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn28\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref28\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[28]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  With a clear cultural conjunction in the elephants, one can infer that the\\n  rhinoceros carries a similar signification.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The rhinoceros also appears in Francesco I de Medici’s sixteenth-century\\n  fabricated grotto in the Garden of Castello at the outskirts of Florence (<i\\n    >figure 12</i\\n  >). The menagerie of 36 animals include, among others, native European fauna:\\n  an Indian elephant, rhinoceros, and goat, an African lion, giraffe, and camel,\\n  and a New World turkey—referred to as <i>gallina d’ India </i>in inventories\\n  and the larger courtly milieu in Rome and Florence, and often equated with the\\n  peacock (which could explain Stradano’s peacock plumes on his allegory of\\n  America).<a href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn29\\\" name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref29\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[29]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  This composite reflects a similar approach to both Buti’s imagery and Medici\\n  cataloging of precious objects. This conflation of culture is mirrored by the\\n  liberal nature of cataloging by terminology and categorization in Medici\\n  inventories c.1539 and 1564, which classified objects by type, such as\\n  weapons, costumes, animals, and masks, rather than separating them by\\n  geographic region.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn30\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref30\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[30]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  Further, according to Claudia Lazzaro, the Indian rhinoceros was rarely seen\\n  in person, but Albrecht Durer’s 1515 print (<i>figure 13</i>) made wide\\n  circulation and was most likely the model for the grotto.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn31\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref31\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[31]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  It is possible that the print stood in for Buti’s rendering as well, forming a\\n  clear association with India. Thus, the rhinoceros in its clear connection to\\n  the grotto, and the elephants and their connection to the Turks, form a\\n  central line across the fresco that represents not only conquest but a New\\n  World that overlaps with Indian cultural signifiers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Imagery tied to India featuring New World natives was also present in\\n  circulating prints and atlases during Buti’s period. German painter and\\n  printmaker Hans Burgkmair’s c.1526 print series\\n  <i>People of Calicut: The Triumphal Procession of Emperor Maximilian I </i>(<i\\n    >figures 14, 15, 16</i\\n  >) features an interwoven group of disparate figures. The leader wears a\\n  turban and rides an elephant, followed by a processional of figures in New\\n  World feather headdresses and skirts marching with an array of animals, and\\n  carrying another leader on a bier with a parasol.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn32\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref32\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[32]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  Buti’s <i>tondo </i>is a similar parade. William Sturtevant notes that the\\n  <i>Calicut </i>print’s details were derived from accounts of Balthasar\\n  Springer’s c. 1505-6 travels to India.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn33\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref33\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[33]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  Peter Mason argues that Burgkmair’s <i>Calicut </i>prints contain both\\n  American and Indian imagery—a detail that both mimics Buti’s cross-cultural\\n  depictions in the armory and reveals that one cannot attribute all featherwork\\n  to American natives.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn34\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref34\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[34]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  In grouping these seemingly disparate figures together in one procession,\\n  Burgkmair inextricably links their geographic proximity. Burgkmair’s\\n  processional demonstrates a commixing of cultures present in all four of\\n  Buti’s battle scenes and central <i>tondo</i>—turbaned Turks, feathered\\n  American natives, and an assembly of Asian and Indian animals—while collecting\\n  them under the canopy of “Calicut.” Georg Braun and Franz Hogenberg’s c. 1572\\n  colored print of the shores of Calicut in the widely circulated atlas of\\n  cities <i>Civitates Orbis Terrarum </i>(<i>figures 17, 18</i>) also shares\\n  pictorial congruence with Buti’s <i>tondo </i>scene.\\n  <i>Zamorin of Calicut</i> depicts a sprawling coast filled with ships, their\\n  course of travel ambiguous, and natives parading on the sand with a parasol\\n  and their emperor on a bier—similar to Buti’s parade of Amerindians in their\\n  costume, weaponry, and classicized gait, as well as his native with the\\n  rhinoceros, who wears a comparable headdress with a tail of hair whipping in\\n  the wind. To the far right are two fat elephants roaming inland. That a\\n  feathered native and chief on a bier can be considered both from America and\\n  Calicut/India, and elephants can be Turkish or Indian demonstrates the looser\\n  visual demarcation regarding the New World as a geographic place still\\n  prevalent in Buti’s period and fully adopted into Medici visual culture.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  That Burgkmair and Braun/Hogenberg’s depictions of Calicutians use similar\\n  iconographic tropes presented in Buti’s American natives could indicate\\n  confusion, a conflation of “foreign,” “exotic,” “Indian,” or “New World”\\n  things. By borrowing from multiple circulating prints and codices, Buti\\n  created adulterated images in the armory that likely seemed familiar to the\\n  viewer but lacked specificity. Evidence that the Medici were slower to let go\\n  of cultural consolidation and references to the Indies is also present in\\n  contemporary maps that were important cultural artifacts. The Guardaroba (<i\\n    >figure 19</i\\n  >) was another colossal project spearheaded by the Medici family meant to\\n  bring order to their collection of transcontinental objects through organizing\\n  objects by region, but was never fully realized. Unlike the typical\\n  <i>studiolo </i>that often combined New World objects with unknown provenance\\n  into the broad category of “The Indies,”<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn35\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref35\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[35]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  fifty-three maps were painted by Egnazio Danti and Stefano Buonsignori on\\n  large cabinet doors that were to house hundreds of objects corresponding to\\n  each map’s location. Completed in 1586, the project marked a paradigm shift in\\n  mapmaking during the period. The maps were rooted in Ptolemaic tradition but\\n  updated to reflect discoveries and fluctuating understanding of landmasses.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn36\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref36\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[36]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  The inventory and contents of the Guardaroba cabinets are an unresolved\\n  problem, complicating our contemporary understanding of how the Medici viewed\\n  the world. However, much like Buti, we know Egnazio Danti sourced multiple\\n  prints, manuscripts, nautical charts, and travelers’ reports to accurately\\n  portray each region.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn37\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref37\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[37]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  For our purposes, the Guardaroba’s significance lies in the fact that it is\\n  extant proof the Medici understood Africa, Asia, and America as separate\\n  landmasses. But the maps are rooted in, and indeed surpass, the ancient\\n  Ptolemaic tradition which was tied to their humanist and erudite culture,<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn38\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref38\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[38]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  and was also of crucial importance to Vespucci—evident through Vespucci’s\\n  reference to Ptolemaic maps in his early letters.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn39\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref39\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[39]</sup></a\\n  >\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  We also know that Danti consulted Abraham Ortelius’s c.1570 world map from the\\n  <i>Theatrum Orbis Terrarum </i>(<i>figure 20</i>), which was widely known in\\n  the Medici court.<a href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn40\\\" name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref40\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[40]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  It is through Ortelius that we can gain some purchase on one way the Medici\\n  might have conceptualized the New World: while originating from separate\\n  landmasses, there is an indelible intimacy between Southeast Asia, India, and\\n  the Americas. Ortelius’s world map has a clear demarcation of the continents;\\n  however, New Guinea is positioned in close proximity to the Americas, which\\n  physically situates the New World to the east, rather than the west. If the\\n  map were connected at either side to form a globe, the Americas would nearly\\n  touch Cathay. (On Cathay, Tangut, and Mangi on sixteenth-century maps,\\n  <a href=\\\"#wu-tangut-cathay-mangi\\\">see the essay by Peiyue Wu</a>.) Within the\\n  <i>Theatrum Orbis Terrarum </i>there is also a detailed map of the Pacific (<i\\n    >figure 21</i\\n  >), the first of its kind. The Americas are positioned in close proximity to\\n  China, New Guinea, and Japan, leaving a Pacific Ocean that is smaller than how\\n  we understand it today, underscoring the probability that the Medici and their\\n  contemporaries did not completely divorce the Americas from the East.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Ortelius’s <i>Indiae Orientalis, </i>in the same atlas, (<i>figure 22</i>)<i\\n  > </i>reveals similar information to his map of the Pacific. India and\\n  Southeast Asia are presented as a landmass without boundaries, in close\\n  proximity to Japan, Papua New Guinea, and the Americas. The American continent\\n  is labelled in Latin as <i>Americae Siue Indiae</i><i>—</i>“America or India.”\\n  The intimacy of the Americas and the East and its textual connection to India\\n  mirrors Ludovico Buti’s seemingly appropriative armory ceiling, and in this\\n  respect qualifies the logic in commingling Indian signifiers with Brazil and\\n  Aztec in sixteenth-century pictorial representations. German cartographer\\n  Caspar Vopel’s c.1545 map\\n  <i\\n    >Nova Et Integra Vniversaliqve Orbis Totivs IVXTA Germanvm Neotericovm\\n    Traditionem Descriptio</i\\n  >\\n  (copied in Venice c.1558) also joins New Spain with Asia. The Harvard c.1558\\n  copy by Vavassore is divided into 12 prints that make up a map of the world.\\n  In the top left section, <i>India Orientalis </i>is merged with\\n  <i>Asia Magna, Messigo, </i>and <i>Hispania. </i>In the neighboring section to\\n  the right, <i>Asia Orientalis </i>is just above <i>Hispania Major</i>. Further\\n  down the map in what appears to be modern Mexico or South America is\\n  <i>America Nova Orbis Pars </i>(<i>figures 23, 24, 25, 26</i>)<i>.</i>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  While Vopel’s map did not originate in Italy, Florence was not divorced from\\n  the culture from which it emerged; as demonstrated, prints from Germany,\\n  Antwerp, and across Europe played some role in developing the courtly\\n  worldview of an America conjoined with, or closely related to, Asia.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn41\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref41\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[41]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  With this in mind, it is likely the Medici and their artists understood the\\n  New World and its natives to be of the East and aligned more closely\\n  ideologically with the expansive India Orient that in the Ptolemaic tradition\\n  lies “beyond the Ganges,” or as Columbus described during his second voyage in\\n  1494, Alpha-Omega, where east meets west.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn42\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref42\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[42]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  This general perception was in flux, as some maps were reformulated to reflect\\n  newly discovered landmasses, while goods—even people—arrived in Florence\\n  through Medici connections and gift exchange.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn43\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref43\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[43]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  In painting the armory ceiling to supplement the weapons on display, Ludovico\\n  Buti was responding to the New World context as framed by Medici court\\n  culture.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  As Eviatar Zerubavel argues, Vespucci was one of few pundits who set the\\n  precedent for the intellectual shift of imagining and depicting the New World\\n  as a separate landmass from Asia.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn44\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref44\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[44]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  Why, then, did the Medici continue to reference imagery that continued to\\n  conflate the two continents, in turn depicting an ambiguous amalgam of\\n  cultures on the armory ceiling? Due to the ubiquitous nature of these widely\\n  known prints disseminated within the court, narrative and ethnographic\\n  pictorial representations were slower to follow suit. The Medici embraced\\n  these anachronistic tendencies by using them as references in their imagery.\\n  Even maps such as those contained in Ortelius’s atlas that separated the\\n  continents weren’t entirely confident that America wasn’t part of Asia.\\n  Further, the Medici family’s liberal practice of categorizing objects, coupled\\n  with the fluid definition of the word “Indian,” helped build an environment in\\n  which projection of the New World mirrored the Old, lightly grasping at\\n  Ptolemaic tradition. Thus, the idea of a continent of America untouched by\\n  Asia was slow to formulate even in Medici Florence where Vespucci carried a\\n  legacy. The armory was a commission by a powerful Ducal family in the midst of\\n  establishing its identity not only among dignitaries from Spain and Portugal\\n  who had a hand in New World exploration, but also within a shifting worldview\\n  that required revisions of its classical antecedent.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn45\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref45\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[45]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  The result is a representation of a New World that is not completely divorced\\n  from Asia, situated in a court culture that was simultaneously well aware of\\n  Vespucci’s innovative observations of a separate New World. Thus the fresco is\\n  an example of a hyper-local, as well as larger, continental identity in flux—a\\n  process of reconciliation of the anachronistic Ptolemaic ancient practice and\\n  development of an understanding of a brand-new, largely unknown society across\\n  the Atlantic. The Medici were working through what Zerubavel calls “denial”–\\n  “a way of resisting the unfamiliar by forcing it into familiar mental niches,\\n  thereby practically denying its novelty or unusualness.”<sup> </sup\\n  ><a href=\\\"#_weitzman_edn46\\\" name=\\\"_weitzman_ednref46\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n    ><sup>[46]</sup></a\\n  >\\n  A dichotomy existed between Francesco’s desire to have agency in the discovery\\n  of the New World and its profound implications on the early modern world. In\\n  step with the loose categorization of Medici objects, appropriation of\\n  multifarious New World prints and texts circulating throughout Europe, and the\\n  atlases that situated the American landmass in the East, Ferdinando projected\\n  an image of Amerasia on the armory ceiling that the Medici court would have\\n  expected to see.\\n</p>\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n<h3>Bibliography</h3>\\n<p>\\n  Boone, Elizabeth Hill. “Seeking Indianness: Christoph Weiditz, the Aztecs, and\\n  Feathered Amerindians.” <i>Colonial Latin American Review</i>, vol. 26, no. 1,\\n  2017, pp. 39–61.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Davies, Surekha.\\n  <i\\n    >Renaissance Ethnography and the Invention of the Human: New Worlds, Maps\\n    and Monsters</i\\n  >.

Tangut (Northwestern\\n    China), Cathay (Northern China), and Mangi (Southern China), the three main destinations on Polo’s itinerary in\\n    China, were upheld as the three main toponyms used to represent China in sixteenth century world maps, while\\n    “Canton”, the most important port city for Portuguese travelers in the sixteenth century, had not yet been shown in\\n    those maps.<a href=\\\"#_edn1\\\"\\n                  name=\\\"_ednref1\\\"\\n                  title=\\\"\\\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> At first glance it seems the cartographic representation of China remained\\n    intact, but if we look closer at the toponyms in its surroundings we begin to see that the representation of its\\n    geographical relationship with the New World did change.</p>\\n<p>By pointing out how several toponyms moved around the Old-World reference points --Cathay, Tangut, and Mangi --in a\\n    series of maps, I aim to show how Europeans reconfigured their conceptions of the world’s expansiveness and the\\n    distinctive ways that they imagined Amerasia. The main body of the essay is divided into three sections\\n    corresponding to the categorization of ten selected maps. While two body sections contain different manifestations\\n    of Amerasia, the Amerasian phenomenon is absent in the remaining one.

The development of world maps in the sixteenth century could not be seen as a teleological process where a\\n    much clearer picture of the modern worldview came into being over time. Instead, it was a period when plural\\n    worldviews driven by different ideologies co-existed and reshaped each other during the sixteenth century. While\\n    Amerasia was a dominant worldview in the sixteenth century, it did adjust and rearrange itself, responding to the\\n    challenges posed by its opposite side --the maps showing the hypothesis that Asia and the New World were separated\\n    from one another. Meanwhile, even maps or mapmakers that experimented with a two-continent vision were subject to\\n    changing their minds, as Waldseemüller reverted to an Amerasian vision of the world in his 1516 Carta Marina.\\n    Furthermore, sometimes even when maps separated the continents, they still embraced an Amerasian view.</p>\\n<p><b>The Amerasian phenomenon in the North</b></p>\\n<p>After Waldseemüller, many began to accept that South America was a New World, but the North American connection to\\n    Asia persisted. In the middle of the sixteenth century there emerged a third type of world map which separated the\\n    east coast of Asia from the lower part of today’s North America with a vast ocean. </p>\\n<p>In response to this trend of separating Asia from today’s North America in the area around the Tropic of Cancer, the\\n    Amerasian phenomenon persisted by spreading northward. The displacement of several Asian toponyms around Cathay,\\n    such as Ania and Toloman, plays an essential role in displaying Amerasia’s new form at the stage when China was no\\n    longer intermingled with Mexico.<a href=\\\"#_edn5\\\"\\n                                       name=\\\"_ednref5\\\"\\n                                       title=\\\"\\\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> According to Marco Polo, Toloman was an Asian kingdom\\n    in southwestern China abundant in gold.

The publication of a new edition of <i>The Travels of Marco Polo </i>published by Ramusio in the 1550s pushed\\n    the Amerasian phenomenon into a new form in the north, responding to the maps that separate Asia and the New World\\n    in the area near the Tropic of Cancer. When European cartographers expressed the idea of Amerasia they could either\\n    squeeze some toponyms of the New World into Asia, as they did in the region near the Tropic of Cancer, or they could\\n    extend some Asian toponymies, like Toloman, towards the other side of world, as they did in the North.</p>\\n</div>\\n<hr>\\n<div id=edn1>\\n    <p><a href=\\\"#_ednref1\\\"\\n          name=\\\"_edn1\\\"\\n          title=\\\"\\\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>Serge Gruzinski mentions that although the Portuguese had reached the Chinese coast\\n        by 1513, sailing form Malacca.

It is said that he is a\\n    lineal descendant of the Magi, of whom mention is made in the Gospel.”<a\\n      href=\\\"#pivar_edn2\\\"\\n      name=\\\"pivar_ednref2\\\"\\n      title=\\\"\\\"\\n      ><sup>[2]</sup></a\\n    >\\n    These rumors fed the desire for more concrete evidence, soon to come in a\\n    [supposed] letter from Prester John to the Pope in Rome, from 1165. The many\\n    adaptations of the <i>Letter </i>advanced Prester John’s legend, according\\n    to which he was “ruling in ‘India,’ a geographical expression that to\\n    Europeans in 1165 and later meant nothing more specific than a land lying to\\n    the east.”<a href=\\\"#pivar_edn3\\\" name=\\\"pivar_ednref3\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n      ><sup>[3]</sup></a\\n    >\\n    The <i>Letter</i> further referred to his domain extending over ‘three\\n    Indies,’ which in the European vernacular of the period referred to a vague\\n    tripartite categorization of the land masses beyond the Arab world into\\n    Lesser, Greater, and Middle India. Likewise, the Ethiopian people would be\\n    designated Indians.<a href=\\\"#pivar_edn4\\\" name=\\\"pivar_ednref4\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n      ><sup>[4]</sup></a\\n    >\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n    With increasing European trade with Cathay and the possibility of making a\\n    pact with the Mongols in the fight against the Muslims, the\\n    <i>Letter</i> spurred on Marco Polo’s quest in the East from 1271 to 1295.\\n    All of the accounts in the literature portray Prester John as a powerful\\n    Christian, or Nestorian, king who ruled a land that can only be described as\\n    utopian, a land of abundance and wealth and peace. As what often occurs with\\n    the synchronicity of the collective consciousness, Prester John is to be\\n    found [in the literature] in places<sup> </sup>associated with the\\n    geopolitical and religious zeitgeist. Prester John’s importance to the\\n    medieval Christian world is prodigious as it perpetuates the notion that a\\n    failing Christendom is not inevitable and that continued expansion of its\\n    realm is attainable.<a href=\\\"#pivar_edn5\\\" name=\\\"pivar_ednref5\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n      ><sup>[5]</sup></a\\n    >\\n    In the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the dissemination of the\\n    legend of Prester John shifted him from Asia to Ethiopia, as a reflection of\\n    cartographical amendments to the fusion of eastern Asia and eastern\\n    Africa.<a href=\\\"#pivar_edn6\\\" name=\\\"pivar_ednref6\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n      ><sup>[6]</sup></a\\n    >\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n    Columbus was purported to have traveled West with Polo’s <i>Travels</i>, and\\n    to have owned <i>The Book of John Mandeville </i>as well as<i> </i>the\\n    <i>Letter </i>of Prester John<i>.</i\\n    ><a href=\\\"#pivar_edn7\\\" name=\\\"pivar_ednref7\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n      ><i\\n        ><sup><b>[7]</b></sup></i\\n      ></a\\n    ><i> </i>When Europe came to understand Columbus’ discoveries, the<i>\\n      Letter</i\\n    >\\n    was adapted into verse by Calabrian priest Giuliano Dati, first published in\\n    Rome in 1493 (Figs. 1a, 1b).<a\\n      href=\\\"#pivar_edn8\\\"\\n      name=\\\"pivar_ednref8\\\"\\n      title=\\\"\\\"\\n      ><sup>[8]</sup></a\\n    >\\n    Either a priest or rimester sang of the tale of Prester John in the streets\\n    in <i>ottava rima</i> to the common man; the songs became legendary\\n    themselves.<a href=\\\"#pivar_edn9\\\" name=\\\"pivar_ednref9\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n      ><sup>[9]</sup></a\\n    >\\n  </p>\\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\\n  <p>\\n    <img\\n      width=\\\"204\\\"\\n      height=\\\"301\\\"\\n      src=\\\"pivar-images/image001.jpg\\\"\\n      alt=\\\"A plaque on a wall&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated\\\"\\n    />\\n    <img\\n      width=\\\"211\\\"\\n      height=\\\"301\\\"\\n      src=\\\"pivar-images/image002.jpg\\\"\\n      alt=\\\"A close up of a newspaper&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated\\\"\\n    />\\n  </p>\\n  <p>Fig. 1a                                                       Fig. 1b</p>\\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\\n  <p><b> </b></p>\\n  <p>\\n    To understand the scope of Prester John’s grip on the European imagination\\n    it is necessary not only to read the literature but to consider visual\\n    representations. Depictions of Prester John and his realm are ubiquitous\\n    early on, most notably in maps, as European cartographers’ dependence on\\n    maps was a crucial element in pinpointing the location of Prester John.\\n    According to Carlson, any map depicting Africa during the 300 years after\\n    Marco Polo was not considered complete without picturing or referencing\\n    Prester John.<a href=\\\"#pivar_edn10\\\" name=\\\"pivar_ednref10\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n      ><sup>[10]</sup></a\\n    >\\n    These cartographers appear to locate Prester John in places that produced\\n    the least confusion about the changing world. Prester John’s prominence of\\n    place on maps was due to a desire to ascribe certainty to the inconstant and\\n    mutable worldview. Maps from the Middle Ages had depicted Ethiopia and India\\n    as bordering land massed, with the Indian Ocean severely reduced. In the Age\\n    of Exploration European cosmographers divided India in two parts, Indus and\\n    the Ganges and Beyond the Ganges, with Africa depicted separately.\\n  </p>\\n  <p>\\n    In a 1450-60 <i>Catalan World Map</i>, by an anonymous Spanish artist (Figs.\\n    2a, 2b),<a href=\\\"#pivar_edn11\\\" name=\\\"pivar_ednref11\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n      ><sup>[11]</sup></a\\n    >\\n    Prester John is located in Africa and is depicted as a dark-skinned ruler\\n    sitting on a throne in a tent, surrounded by other rulers of the continent.\\n    While clearly not a European, he wears contemporary European clothing and a\\n    crown, holds a scepter, and appears very imperial.\\n  </p>\\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\\n  <p>\\n    <img\\n      width=\\\"225\\\"\\n      height=\\\"237\\\"\\n      src=\\\"pivar-images/image003.jpg\\\"\\n      alt=\\\"Content Placeholder 4\\\"\\n    />\\n  </p>\\n\\n  <p>Fig. 2a</p>\\n  <p>\\n    <img\\n      width=\\\"289\\\"\\n      height=\\\"289\\\"\\n      src=\\\"pivar-images/image004.jpg\\\"\\n      alt=\\\"Picture 3\\\"\\n    />\\n  </p>\\n\\n  <p>Fig. 2b</p>\\n  <p>\\n    In the so-called <i>Genoese Planisphere</i> of 1457 (Fig. 3),<a\\n      href=\\\"#pivar_edn12\\\"\\n      name=\\\"pivar_ednref12\\\"\\n      title=\\\"\\\"\\n      ><sup>[12]</sup></a\\n    >\\n    by an anonymous Florentine, Prester John is located in Africa and is\\n    depicted as a very dark-skinned Ethiopian Christian ruler wearing a crown\\n    and holding aloft a Crusades banner surmounted by a cross.  His costume is\\n    more typically Eastern, with his head tied up in a turban that flows down\\n    his shoulders and back.\\n  </p>\\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\\n  <p>\\n    <img\\n      width=\\\"283\\\"\\n      height=\\\"318\\\"\\n      src=\\\"pivar-images/image005.jpg\\\"\\n      alt=\\\"Content Placeholder 4\\\"\\n    />\\n  </p>\\n\\n  <p>Fig. 3</p>\\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\\n  <p>\\n    Hartmann Schedel’s <i>Nuremberg Chronicle</i> of 1493 (Fig. 4)<a\\n      href=\\\"#pivar_edn13\\\"\\n      name=\\\"pivar_ednref13\\\"\\n      title=\\\"\\\"\\n      ><sup>[13]</sup></a\\n    >\\n    portrays Prester John as a medieval monk with costumes and furniture in\\n    Gothic style.

By the 15th century, one of the kings was frequently shown as\\n  African, and as Europeans continued to explore the larger world, images of the\\n  Magi reveal shifting ideas of time and place.\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn9\\\" name=\\\"_ednref9\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[9]</a> As the first gentiles to\\n  worship Christ, the Magi are not only precursors to European Christians, but\\n  also potential models for non-European converts to Christianity.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Visual representations of the Magi provide a valuable lens for considering how\\n  early modern artists and viewers might have understood the changing geography\\n  of the world around them. This essay begins from a self-consciously modern\\n  perspective of what constitutes an ÒAmericanÓ magus, progressively expanding\\n  this category to consider images which early modern viewers might have\\n  understood as ÒAmerasian.Ó By beginning from a modern worldview and\\n  systematically shifting its parameters, it is possible to explore the varied\\n  and flexible ways in which American iconography is incorporated with other\\n  geographic references, and thus consider the range of ways in which early\\n  modern Europeans might have understood the Magi in relation to the New World.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  An early sixteenth-century <i>Adoration of the Magi</i> attributed to Vasco\\n  Fernandes (Figure 1) is the touchstone of scholarly discussions about an\\n  American Magus. The figures crowd in the foreground: the Madonna sits with the\\n  Christ Child on her lap behind a low parapet, and the three Magi approach her\\n  from the left. The eldest king kneels with his hat off and his hands clasped\\n  in prayer; he has already given his gift, which the Virgin now passes to\\n  Joseph. Behind him stand the other two Magi, one removing his hat in\\n  reverence, the other striding forward and holding out his gift. It is this\\n  third Magus who has captured scholarly attention. His feather headdress and\\n  the arrow he holds have been convincingly identified with the Tupinamba people\\n  of Brazil, first encountered by the Portuguese explorer Pedro Alvares Cabral\\n  in 1500, shortly before the date of FernandesÕ painting.\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn10\\\" name=\\\"_ednref10\\\" title=\\\"\\\"> [10] </a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Joseph Koerner and others have noted that this connection to Portuguese\\n  exploration is crucial for understanding the painting and its inclusion of an\\n  American Magus. Indeed, FernandesÕ painting was part of an altar retable for\\n  the cathedral of Viseu, CabralÕs hometown, and the third kingÕs telltale\\n  iconography&#8212;the headdress with colorful parrot feathers&#8212;stems\\n  directly from accounts of the people encountered on this voyage.\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn11\\\" name=\\\"_ednref11\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[11] </a> Yet the figure is\\n  clothed, in a striking departure from the European descriptions of naked\\n  natives they had encountered in the New World. This has previously been\\n  explained in terms of theological necessity, in that it would breach all rules\\n  of decorum to show a nude Magus.\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn12\\\" name=\\\"_ednref12\\\" title=\\\"\\\"> [12] </a> Koerner goes further,\\n  arguing also that clothing served also as a means of ÒtamingÓ the figure, much\\n  as Cabral attempted to do by introducing some of the Tupinamba he encountered\\n  to European customs. <a href=\\\"#_edn13\\\" name=\\\"_ednref13\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[13] </a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  In an attempt to step outside of this unidirectional model of European\\n  hegemony attempting to ÒcivilizeÓ the Tupinamba, it is worth considering the\\n  ways in which foreignness and familiarity are productively held in tension.\\n  The fundamental difference of the Tupinamba MagusÕs featherwork keeps him from\\n  being wholly assimilated, but the addition of clothing resembling a doublet\\n  and knee breeches allows him to enter into European representational\\n  conventions rather than being just an exotic Òother.Ó\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn14\\\" name=\\\"_ednref14\\\" title=\\\"\\\"> [14] </a> These two systems of\\n  clothing (and of cultural coding) are in fact melded, rather than simply being\\n  overlaid: the Tupinamba feathers are intermingled with the figureÕs\\n  Europeanizing clothing, incorporated around the edges of the figureÕs doublet.\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn15\\\" name=\\\"_ednref15\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[15] </a> The Tupinamba Magus\\n  strides into representation and recognizability, his Europeanized garb\\n  bringing him just close enough to a Portuguese visual language for his\\n  foreignness to be comprehensible.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  CabralÕs voyage to Brazil also opens geographic&#8212;as well as\\n  cultural&#8212;questions. His landfall in Brazil was accidental: he intended\\n  to sail around the Cape of Good Hope to reach India, but went off course in\\n  the tropics, resulting in his brief sojourn in Brazil before returning across\\n  the Atlantic to complete his original voyage.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_edn16\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_ednref16\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    >[16]\\n  </a>\\n  While to modern viewers, Brazil and West Africa are two fundamentally\\n  different locations separated by the Atlantic Ocean, early 16th century\\n  navigators did not yet have a means of calculating longitude. Instead, they\\n  divided the world latitudinally into polar zones, temperate zones, and\\n  tropical zones.<a href=\\\"#_edn17\\\" name=\\\"_ednref17\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[17] </a> For\\n  Cabral&#8212;and for Fernandes&#8212;it would be logical to draw parallels\\n  between different peoples living in the tropics. Indeed, Fernandes depicts the\\n  third Magus with some of the features common to African figures: his short\\n  textured hair and his dark skin, as well as his earring and jewelry, could\\n  also be associated with Africa.<a href=\\\"#_edn18\\\" name=\\\"_ednref18\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n    [18]\\n  </a>\\n  Additionally, rather than including both an African Magus and a New World\\n  Magus, the Tupinamba figure supplants his African predecessor. Here, then,\\n  similitude is sufficient to justify substitution.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  It is also worth considering how replacing an African Magus&#8212;who by this\\n  point had become a staple of Magian imagery&#8212;with a New World Magus\\n  reshapes the understanding of the Three Kings arriving Òab oriente,Ó from the\\n  east. For Fernandes, working in Portugal, much of Africa was to the east, and\\n  yet Portuguese explorers reached Africa by sailing south. Relative to\\n  Bethlehem, where the nativity of Christ occurred, most of Africa is south and\\n  west. Though the Horn of Africa extends further east than the Holy Land,\\n  traveling from East Africa to Bethlehem would still predominantly be a\\n  northward journey. Prester John&#8212;understood as a descendant of one of the\\n  Magi&#8212;was often situated in East Africa, but on the Vopel Map at least he\\n  appears in Abassia, directly south of the Holy Land.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_edn19\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_ednref19\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    >[19]\\n  </a>\\n  [<a href=\\\"#pivar-presterjohn\\\">See the essay on Prester John by Larimore Pivar</a>] An African Magus, then, is\\n  difficult to comprehend as coming from the east, which perhaps enables this\\n  figure to be replaced in the Viseu altarpiece with an American Magus, who\\n  similarly complicates a directional understanding of the Magi.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  An Amerasian worldview, particularly at the beginning of the 16th century,\\n  could sustain the possibility that Brazil marked a point at which east and\\n  west meet. If New World was understood as being connected to East Asia&#8212;a\\n  worldview that is wholly supported by the Vopel Map&#8212;it is possible that\\n  a Magus from Brazil could have made an immensely long land journey across the\\n  New World and Asia to reach Bethlehem.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_edn20\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_ednref20\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    >[20]\\n  </a>\\n  From a European vantage point, however, people in the New World were reached\\n  by traveling west, not east&#8212;a distinction which is particularly\\n  important for the Portuguese and Spanish, who used this directional model to\\n  determine their mercantile and colonial powers over any lands discovered by\\n  sea.<a href=\\\"#_edn21\\\" name=\\\"_ednref21\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[21] </a> Two-dimensional\\n  cartographic representations also echo this directionality: although a land\\n  voyage would be possible given the geographic configuration of the Vopel Map,\\n  its organization of the world onto a flat plane nonetheless situates Brazil to\\n  the west of Jerusalem.

In this representation, the western end of\\n  Brazil is left undetermined, and it is uncertain whether a land route\\n  traveling westward would even be possible.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  An anonymous Bolognese painting of the <i>Adoration of the Magi</i> (<a\\n    href=\\\"http://catalogo.fondazionezeri.unibo.it/scheda.v2.jsp?locale=en&amp;decorator=layout_resp&amp;apply=true&amp;tipo_scheda=F&amp;id=83108&amp;titolo=Anonimo+-+Anonimo+bolognese+-+sec.+XVI+-+Adorazione+dei+Re+Magi+-+insieme\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\">here</a\\n  >), dating to the mid to late 16th century, again implies an Amerasian\\n  worldview in which someone from the New World could have traveled to see the\\n  infant Christ. Here, however, the figure in question is not one of the three\\n  kings presenting their gifts before the Madonna and Child in the center\\n  foreground (<a\\n    href=\\\"http://catalogo.fondazionezeri.unibo.it/scheda.v2.jsp?locale=en&amp;decorator=layout_resp&amp;apply=true&amp;tipo_scheda=F&amp;id=83111&amp;titolo=Anonimo+-+Anonimo+bolognese+-+sec.+XVI+-+Adorazione+dei+Re+Magi+-+particolare\\\"\\n     target=\\\"_blank\\\">here</a\\n  >). These kings reveal a range of skin tones and geographical markers, and can\\n  plausibly be identified as a kneeling East Asian king who gazes up at the\\n  Christ Child who blesses him, a dark-skinned African king with a turban, and\\n  another turbaned king with a beard who is likely Near Eastern.\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn22\\\" name=\\\"_ednref22\\\" title=\\\"\\\"> [22] </a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  One of the figures in the midground at the left of the panel (<a\\n    href=\\\"http://catalogo.fondazionezeri.unibo.it/scheda.v2.jsp?locale=en&amp;decorator=layout_resp&amp;apply=true&amp;tipo_scheda=F&amp;id=83110&amp;titolo=Anonimo+-+Anonimo+bolognese+-+sec.+XVI+-+Corteo+dei+Re+Magi+-+particolare\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\">here</a\\n  >), however, appears to be wearing a feathered headdress and other feathered\\n  decoration around his neck, attire which strikingly resembles the woodcut\\n  images of cannibals made to illustrate an account of the discoveries of\\n  Amerigo Vespucci (Figure 2). Though it is currently impossible to identify the\\n  animal he is riding, the figure holds a heraldic trumpet, suggesting that he\\n  is a part of the entourage of one of the three kings. This seems to support\\n  the belief that the people of the New World were, in fact, inhabitants of\\n  Asia. The feathered figure here, then, must be understood as both a figure\\n  from the New World and the subject of an East Asian monarch. While to modern\\n  eyes, this appears to be an erroneous conflation of America and Asia,\\n  understanding the painting on its own historical terms allows both of these\\n  identities to coexist within the same figure. As the Vopel Map attests,\\n  portions of East Asia known to Marco Polo and the newly discovered New World\\n  were sufficiently proximate geographically to justify the presence of a New\\n  World figure in the retinue of a far eastern king.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The other set of Magian images which, to our modern perspective, clearly\\n  include figures from the New World are paintings created in the Americas.\\n  Trexler notes that particularly in the Andean region around modern Peru,\\n  European colonizers of the early 16th century sought for evidence that\\n  Christianity had already reached the New World in antiquity, including by\\n  suggesting the possibility of a Native American Magus.\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn23\\\" name=\\\"_ednref23\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[23] </a> A 17th century Peruvian\\n  painting by Diego de la Puente visualizes this possibility, showing one of the\\n  Magi in the robes and headdress of an Incan king (<a\\n    href=\\\"https://preview.redd.it/kvlncjnjql101.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04faf8eac1df70c5d6b0646654e5925f34353f65\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\">here</a\\n  >). <a href=\\\"#_edn24\\\" name=\\\"_ednref24\\\" title=\\\"\\\"> [24] </a> Unlike European\\n  images with New World figures, the inclusion of an Incan Magus here is most\\n  likely motivated by practical and propagandistic reasons. In the Andes,\\n  depicting three Magi from the Old World (for instance, an African figure, an\\n  Ottoman figure, and a Chinese figure) would have been all but unintelligible\\n  to most non-Europeans. The inclusion of an Incan Magus&#8212;particularly in\\n  conjunction with an African Magus, who would also represent a potentially\\n  recognizable physiognomic type, given the rise of trans-Atlantic\\n  slavery&#8212;makes the painting more accessible and comprehensible to its\\n  immediate audience. The Incan Magus could also serve as a model for native\\n  peoples, who could be directed to emulate this painted figure in their own\\n  devotion to Christ.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The paintings discussed above all contain figures who can be convincingly\\n  associated with the New World, suggesting that the route of the Magi passed\\n  through America. Such clear examples, however, are rare. Does this scarcity\\n  reflect a lack of interest among early modern Europeans in depicting New World\\n  Magi, or does it reflect the narrowness of our current definition of\\n  ÒAmericanÓ?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a>\\n    An Amerasian worldview could broaden this inquiry to also consider figures\\n    whose foreignness may include or refer to the New World, but in conjunction\\n    with areas that we now see as different geographic regions such as India and\\n    Africa. These images are particularly intriguing because of the flexibility\\n    of the term ÒIndiaÓ in the early modern period, variously encompassing East\\n    Africa, areas of South and East Asia, and the West Indies. <a\\n    href=\\\"#riccio-india\\\">[See the essay on India and Indians by Vittoria\\n    Riccio]</a\\n  >\\n  Figures that appear to modern scholars to contain mixed iconography might have\\n  been originally intended to represent inhabitants of a greater India. To our\\n  eyes, the connections between the subsequent images and the New World appear\\n  more tenuous, but for some early modern viewers this iconography might have\\n  resonated with imagery from both the Old World and the New.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  A particularly rich subject for this avenue of investigation is Francisco de\\n  HolandaÕs <i> Adoration of the Magi</i> (<a\\n    href=\\\"http://bdh-rd.bne.es/viewer.vm?id=0000137315&amp;page=86\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\">here</a\\n  >), from his <i>De aetatibus mundi imagines</i>, a collection of cosmological\\n  drawings from the Creation to the Apocalypse. The three Magi kneel at the\\n  right of the page, each modeling a different form of devotion toward the\\n  seated Virgin and the Child she holds. The foremost Magus presses his hands to\\n  the ground, his face down; this particular posture of worship, in conjunction\\n  with the curved sword at his side, may suggest a Near Eastern figure. The\\n  second Magus, who is also elderly and bearded, bows down much like his\\n  companion. His hands, however, are clasped in a European gesture of prayer,\\n  and his face remains turned toward the Madonna and Christ. If the Magus at the\\n  front appears to visualize an Islamic gesture of prayer, the second Magus is\\n  more reminiscent of medieval and Byzantine donor portraits, in a pose of\\n  <i>proskynesis</i> or veneration.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Unlike the foremost two Magi, whose very similar physiognomies, clothing, and\\n  poses offer only a suggestion of their geographic origins, the third Magus\\n  provides an entire range of potentially locatable iconography. The features of\\n  this Magus and of his followers&#8212;one depicted frontally, and another\\n  shown in profile, as though providing a full range of views with which to be\\n  able to understand these figures&#8212;are similar to those given to African\\n  Magi, as seen in a painting by DŸrer (<a\\n    href=\\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_-_L%27Adoration_des_mages.jpg\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\">here</a\\n  >). In addition to their prominent jaws and furrowed brows, these figures are\\n  shown beardless with short curly hair, and they each wear earrings, all\\n  attributes common to African figures.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The figureÕs bangles and headdress, however, point to very different\\n  referents. The distinctive two-plume headdress is strikingly similar to one\\n  worn by a figure on a Sri Lankan casket (<a\\n    href=\\\"https://images.tribuneindia.com/cms/gall_content/2018/2/2018_2$largeimg15_Thursday_2018_223007377gallery.jpg\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\">here</a\\n  >), who also wears armbands and bracelets. As this casket was a gift from the\\n  Sri Lankan ambassador to the Portuguese king, it is possible that Holanda\\n  could have seen it and used it as a model, retaining just the headband and the\\n  plumes of the Sri Lankan headdress.\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn25\\\" name=\\\"_ednref25\\\" title=\\\"\\\"> [25] </a> Figures with similar\\n  bangles and headgear are depicted on the Indian subcontinent in the Portuguese\\n  Miller Atlas, created in 1519 and illustrated by none other than Francisco de\\n  HolandaÕs father Antonio (<a\\n    href=\\\"https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b55002605w/f1.item.zoom\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\">here</a\\n  >). Another comparison could be made to representations of the Mesoamerican\\n  ruler Moctezuma II (<a\\n    href=\\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Houghton_Typ_625.99.800_Istoria_della_conquista_del_Messico_-_Motezuma.jpg\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\">here</a\\n  >\\n  and\\n  <a\\n    href=\\\"https://www.gettyimages.co.nz/detail/illustration/portrait-of-montezuma-ii-tecnochtitlan-last-king-of-stock-graphic/540779689\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\">here</a\\n  >), who also wears gold armbands and a headpiece with a plume to either side.\\n  A typological resemblance between HolandaÕs Magus and the images of Moctezuma\\n  also extends to clothing: both figures are shown seminude, with only a cloak\\n  over their shoulders and another garment tied about their waists.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  While these references read as fundamentally disparate to modern eyes, a\\n  16th-century viewer might have understood them all as falling under the\\n  umbrella of the ÒIndies.Ó A closer understanding of HolandaÕs perception of\\n  art on global terms may also help in clarify these references. As Alessandra\\n  Russo argues in a current project on Francisco de Holanda and artistic\\n  universalism, his commentary in both his <i>Dialogues</i> with Michelangelo\\n  and in <i>Da Pintura Antigua</i> reveals that he already attempted to theorize\\n  art as a universal trait of humanity. This sort of thinking allowed him to\\n  approach Mixtec pottery, for example, and understand it as being comparable to\\n  ancient Greek pottery&#8212;indeed, to consider the possibility that the New\\n  World had contact with Greco-Roman antiquity at some point in the past.\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn26\\\" name=\\\"_ednref26\\\" title=\\\"\\\"> [26] </a> This particular\\n  parallel is especially important for the drawing. Unlike the first two Magi,\\n  who are shown in attitudes of prayer, the third Magus is shown in the act of\\n  offering his gift: he sets down a vessel before the Virgin and Child, which\\n  looks strikingly like an ancient Greek shoulder lekythos (<a\\n    href=\\\"https://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/tools/pottery/shapes/lekythos.htm\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\">here</a\\n  >). His two compatriots, kneeling behind him, also carry their offerings in\\n  vessels, though these are more difficult to identify. It is possible that the\\n  figure on the left may hold a pyxis, and the simpler vessel to the right may\\n  be a krater, but here the parallels to Greek pottery are less distinct.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  These vessels, then, may be a visualization of HolandaÕs concept of universal\\n  antiquity. While the lekythos seems (at least to modern eyes) clearly\\n  identifiable as a Greek vase, the other two slip away from recognizable types.\\n  Perhaps the depiction of these vessels, offered by figures who are clearly\\n  meant to be foreign&#8212;maybe even coming from as far as the New\\n  World&#8212;was meant to suggest a universal antiquity, visualized through\\n  their partial similarity to known Greco-Roman objects. Such an interpretation\\n  might imply that Holanda saw these objects as evolutionarily linked: at some\\n  point in the past, such as at the time when the Magi went to worship Christ,\\n  Greek pottery could have been a universal standard.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  It is also important to discuss a final category of images: Magi who are\\n  depicted using the iconography of African figures, but with the addition of\\n  feathered headwear. As Peter Mason aptly observes, feathers cannot\\n  conclusively prove a connection to America, nor can their absence preclude\\n  such a reference, since they appear both on Amerindian and Asian figures (and,\\n  one might add, on the hats of European and African figures).\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn27\\\" name=\\\"_ednref27\\\" title=\\\"\\\"> [27] </a> Since feather\\n  decoration extends across our modern geographic categories, images of Magi\\n  with feathers could provide a useful case study for considering whether an\\n  Amerasian worldview is in play.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Albrecht DŸrerÕs 1504 painting of the <i>Adoration of the Magi</i> (<a\\n    href=\\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_-_L%27Adoration_des_mages.jpg\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\">here</a\\n  >), and his 1511 print of the same subject (<a\\n    href=\\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_-_The_Adoration_of_the_Magi_%28NGA_1943.3.3672%29.jpg\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\">here</a\\n  >) are particularly helpful for illustrating this phenomenon.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_edn28\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_ednref28\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n  >\\n    [28]\\n  </a>\\n  In the painting, an African Magus&#8212;recognizable not only because of his\\n  dark skin, but also marked by his prominent forehead, pronounced jaw, and\\n  curly hair&#8212;holds an elaborate red hat, decorated with jewels and two\\n  white feathers. Here, the hat is more prominent than its plumes; the feathers\\n  are attached to it solely as a decoration, in the fashion of European caps. By\\n  contrast, in DŸrerÕs 1511 print, the multiple textured feathers are the visual\\n  focus of the hat held by the African Magus. This figure shares the same high\\n  forehead, strong jaw, and short curly hair as the painted figure, making him\\n  recognizably African despite his European garments, replete with slashed\\n  sleeves. A 17th century painting of the <i>Adoration of the Magi</i> by Juan\\n  Bautista Maino also includes an African Magus whose headdress is overwhelmed\\n  by feathers (<a\\n    href=\\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Fray_Juan_Bautista_Maino_-_Adoration_of_the_Kings_-_WGA13870.jpg\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\">here</a\\n  >).<a href=\\\"#_edn29\\\" name=\\\"_ednref29\\\" title=\\\"\\\"> [29] </a> Though MainoÕs\\n  African king appears to have a turban wrapped around his head, the white band\\n  of fabric is fairly narrow, and crowned by brightly-colored feathers, like\\n  those described by Europeans visiting the New World.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_edn30\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_ednref30\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    >[30]\\n  </a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  These final examples illustrate the difficulty of finding recognizably\\n  ÒAmericanÓ figures in early modern depictions of the Magi, and provide a test\\n  case of how far an Amerasian paradigm can be applied to art. Did early modern\\n  viewers understand all of these figures&#8212;and perhaps also Magi who we\\n  today identify as Far Eastern&#8212;as being ÒAmerasian,Ó coming from a place\\n  where east and west meet? Or, conversely, does the relative scarcity of\\n  conclusive visual references to the New World suggest that most artists\\n  understood America as a different location to the west, from which the eastern\\n  Magi could not have come?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  In the absence of clear textual sources from artists or viewers of these\\n  images, this is impossible to determine&#8212;indeed, both of these worldviews\\n  were probably sustained simultaneously, as a result of unequal access to new\\n  geographic information. The four paintings which incontrovertibly reference\\n  the Americas each come from particular contexts where artists could have\\n  obtained privileged knowledge of the New World: Fernandes painted in the\\n  hometown of the Portuguese explorer of Brazil, the Bolognese painting comes\\n  from the city where Charles V and Clement VII met to discuss the implications\\n  of European exploration, and the two Peruvian paintings originate in the New\\n  World itself. Holanda, too, had unique access to information about Portuguese\\n  travel both eastward and westward. It is possible that for such artists, an\\n  Amerasian worldview suggested the importance of relating the Magi to the New\\n  World, while for other artists the Americas did not figure into the story of\\n  the Magi at all.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Ultimately, these images are most useful for highlighting the complexity of\\n  early modern depictions of the Magi. They point to the importance of\\n  reconsidering our own modern geographic categories, so as to begin to\\n  understand the shifting world that European painting sought to visualize.\\n</p>\\n\\n<br clear=\\\"all\\\" />\\n<hr align=\\\"left\\\" size=\\\"1\\\" width=\\\"33%\\\" />\\n<![endif]>\\n<div style=\\\"mso-element:endnote\\\" id=\\\"edn1\\\">\\n  <p class=\\\"MsoEndnoteText\\\">\\n    <a href=\\\"#_ednref1\\\" name=\\\"_edn1\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[1]</a> The label reads ÒTharssis\\n    R[egio] / Hinc Melchiore[m] Ma / gu[m] p[ro]drisse [<i>sic</i> prodisse]\\n    feruntÓ (Kingdom of Tharssis / They report that the Magus Melchior went\\n    forth from here).

In tracing the history of Ô<i\\n    >IndiaÕ</i\\n  >\\n  and its derivatives in the Italian language, it will immediately appear clear\\n  that we are dealing with a fluid and multifaceted term that overcomes the\\n  boundaries of its most immediate meaning. The origin of the word has a\\n  geographical nature: it derives from the Greek <i>&#7992;</i\\n  ><i>&#957;&#948;&#943;</i><i>&#945; </i>(<i>India</i>)<i>, </i>which indicated\\n  the land of the Indus River (<i>Sindhu </i>in Sanskrit, <i>Hindu</i> in Old\\n  Persian); the people inhabiting those regions were called <i>&#7992;</i\\n  ><i>&#957;&#948;&#959;&#943;</i> (<i>Indoi</i>). In its Latin form,\\n  <i>India</i> transmigrated into Italian vernaculars and was often used as an\\n  attribute for precious goods, such as minerals and pigments.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_edn1\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_ednref1\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    >[1]</a\\n  >\\n  Since Antiquity, India represented an <i>other</i> place, a remote land\\n  inhabited by monsters and bizarre creatures in the minds of the Ancient\\n  Greeks, or the location of Terrestrial Paradise in the Middle Ages. These two\\n  extremes speak about a distance that is not only spatial, and that makes India\\n  a fantastic repository of supernatural otherness. The traditional ÒconfusionÓ\\n  between India and Ethiopia perfectly exemplifies this tendency.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_edn2\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_ednref2\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    >[2]</a\\n  >\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The discovery of the New World marks the beginning of a new life for Ô<i\\n    >IndiaÕ; </i\\n  >the sixteenth century represents, in fact, the apex of this longstanding\\n  philological disorder. It is well known how Christopher Columbus, certain he\\n  had landed in Marco PoloÕs Orient, became the first player in a linguistic\\n  misunderstanding that still persists today. A visual example can be observed\\n  in world maps and globes from the sixteenth century that concretely show the\\n  ubiquity of India; in Caspar VopelÕs World Map, for instance, we find several\\n  <i>Indie</i>, disseminated around Asia, America and Africa. It is important,\\n  however, to separate the historical ÒerrorÓ from the linguistic and cultural\\n  one; the former, resolved in a few decades with VespucciÕs famed intuition,\\n  was only the spark that gave life to the latter.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The five editions of the <i>Vocabolario</i\\n  ><i> degli Accademici della Crusca</i> are the perfect tool to investigate\\n  this evolution. The last publication describes India as follows:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n  From the well-known regions of Asia and America designated by this name, and\\n  rich of rare and precious products, India, and more often the plural Indies\\n  denotes, informally and figuratively, Great abundance of any thing, or any\\n  thing that is necessary, and sometimes even ÔGood fortuneÕ, ÔWealthÕ, ÔSource\\n  of wealthÕ and more; and it is used as ÔHaving India or the IndiesÕ, ÔBeing\\n  there India or IndiesÕ, ÔFinding the IndiesÕ [É] ¤ II. To come from the Indies\\n  means to come from remote places with customs and uses different from ours;\\n  and jokingly applied to those who do not know, or seem to ignore, the customs,\\n  or famous facts, of the place where they arrive, or where they are.\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn3\\\" name=\\\"_ednref3\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[3]</a>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>\\n  This definition is permeated by a sense of flexibility that speaks to us about\\n  the multivalence of the term. India is not only a country, it is an entity\\n  (link to India Extra Gangem entry).<a href=\\\"#_edn4\\\" name=\\\"_ednref4\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n    >[4]</a\\n  >\\n  The geographical indicators only serve to blur its physical borders; Asia and\\n  America play an equal role in shaping its identity. India is a synonym for\\n  Wealth and Abundance and, at the same time, a remote land that is\\n  unquestionably different from us. The term becomes a container for any sort of\\n  thing, almost a shape-shifting body that adapts, from time to time, to our\\n  needs. We will see, however, how this apparently universal and fixed value is,\\n  indeed, more subtle, precise and variegated.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The entry for Ô<i>indiano</i><i>Õ</i> provides interesting material as well:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n  Properly used as Ôof India or the IndiesÕ, ÔBelonging to the IndiesÕ; and said\\n  of a person ÔNative of the IndiesÕ; and informally in the manner of Ô<i\\n    >Fare lÕindianoÕ</i\\n  >\\n  (ÔActing like an IndianÕ), which means pretending to ignore what one knows\\n  about acts, facts, or persons, practices, manipulations and more; almost to\\n  make it seem to be from the Indies, or another very distant place and\\n  therefore not informed at all of the things of the country. Same as ÔFare il\\n  nesciÕ or ÔFare lo gnorriÕ [É].\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn5\\\" name=\\\"_ednref5\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[5]</a>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>\\n  The idea of distance returns in this second definition, especially in the\\n  idiom Ô<i>fare lÕindiano</i>Õ or Ôto pretend to ignore something as if you\\n  were coming from such a remote land that you could not be informed of the\\n  facts of this countryÕ. The definition of the <i>Vocabolario</i>, however,\\n  oddly overlooks the consideration of the Indian diffused in the sixteenth\\n  century. The travel literature, the letters, and the accounts of the explorers\\n  all agree on defining the indigenous populations of the Americas as shy,\\n  timid, and na•ve,<a href=\\\"#_edn6\\\" name=\\\"_ednref6\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[6]</a> an idea\\n  that easily translates into a negative conception of the <i>indio</i>, which\\n  becomes a synonym of uncultured, pagan, and savage.\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn7\\\" name=\\\"_ednref7\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[7]</a> <i>ÔIndiano</i>Õ and\\n  <i>Ôfare lÕindiano</i>Õ evoke the same idea of remoteness enclosed in the\\n  definition of <i>India</i>, but at the same time they imply a moral and\\n  cultural judgement. Curiously, the idiom stimulates a question that contains\\n  in itself the first germs of the Amerasian problem: which <i>indiano</i> are\\n  we referring to? The reference to the na•vetŽ inevitably points at the\\n  Amerindians, but the Ôfaraway landÕ corresponds to the Indies, East or West we\\n  cannot know.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  One last observation on the <i>Vocabolario</i> regards chronology. The entries\\n  discussed above only appear in the fifth edition, published between 1843 and\\n  1923, and they are still valid today. Therefore, we are discussing a\\n  relatively recent definition, and this raises a series of questions on the use\\n  of the term in the sixteenth century and the origin of the insightful\\n  description that we find in the nineteenth century. The only obvious mention\\n  of India, present since the first edition of 1612, is the term Ô<i>indico</i\\n  ><i>Õ.</i> <a href=\\\"#_edn8\\\" name=\\\"_ednref8\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[8]</a> This eloquent\\n  absence, however, is not translated into an equivalent silence: Ô<i>IndiaÕ </i\\n  >and Ô<i>indiano</i><i>Õ </i>populate the vocabulary, infiltrating the\\n  definitions of many terms, from Ô<i>gallo</i>Õ to Ô<i>pepe</i>Õ, to\\n  Ô<i>caldo</i>Õ and Ô<i>tamarindi</i>Õ. The occurrence of such attributes,\\n  moreover, multiplies from one publication to the other, to the extreme cases\\n  of Ô<i>poleggio</i><i>Õ </i>and Ô<i>porcellino</i>Õ, in which reference to\\n  India appears only in the fourth edition (1729-38) and is supplemented by a\\n  rather longer definition. The use of India as an attribute is a clear allusion\\n  to the ideas of abundance and distance and it refers, at the same time, to the\\n  various historical conception related to it. The natural abundance of the\\n  Garden of Eden, for instance, or the tales of mythical reigns refulgent of\\n  gold and silver <a href=\\\"#_edn9\\\" name=\\\"_ednref9\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[9]</a> could have\\n  explained, in the Western mind, the profusion of products flooding the\\n  European markets. (On the mapping of Paradise, see the entry on DRACONIS). It\\n  is not surprising, then, that the nomenclature <i>ÔdÕIndiaÕ </i>or\\n  <i>Ôdelle Indie</i>Õ was applied to plants, fruits, animals and luxury goods,\\n  especially if we consider the mercantile culture of the Italian peninsula,\\n  whose contacts with the East were mainly commercial. After 1492, the arrival\\n  of American goods in Europe encountered this sort of mentality, which resulted\\n  in an extension of the nomenclature to these new products. Whether West or\\n  East Indies, these goods were coming from distant countries and therefore\\n  their cost was higher; in this sense, Ô<i>indiano</i>Õ acquires a further\\n  semantic level, denoting more generally things with a non-European provenance,\\n  or Ôexotic.Õ\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  A perfect example of the various uses of Ô<i>IndiaÕ</i> and Õ<i> indiano</i\\n  ><i>Õ </i>is Giorgio Vasari. The first meaning we encounter is the simplest\\n  one:reminiscent of medieval writers and contemporary merchants, he uses the\\n  attribute Ô<i>dÕIndia</i><i>Õ </i>or Ô<i>indiano</i><i>Õ</i> in reference to\\n  animals.<a href=\\\"#_edn10\\\" name=\\\"_ednref10\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[10]</a> In other cases,\\n  Vasari indeed refers to the continent America, therefore using\\n  <i>ÔIndieÕ </i>with a precise geographical intent.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  One example of this is the description of the Guardaroba in Palazzo Vecchio,\\n  where Ignazio Danti painted Ôthe Tables of Ptolemy, all measured with perfect\\n  accuracy and corrected after the most recent authorities, with exact charts of\\n  navigation and their scales for measuring and degrees, done with supreme\\n  diligence; and with these are all the names, both ancient and modernÕ.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_edn11\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_ednref11\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    >[11]</a\\n  >\\n  The tables accurately described by Vasari depict the known world, which, he\\n  tells us, is divided in four equal parts: Europe, Africa, Asia and the West\\n  Indies.<a href=\\\"#_edn12\\\" name=\\\"_ednref12\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[12]</a> The Indies are\\n  mentioned again in relation to the portrait of Amerigo Vespucci Ôwho made the\\n  voyages to the Indies,Õ\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn13\\\" name=\\\"_ednref13\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[13]</a> and one last time in the\\n  description of the Palazzo degli Spini, in Florence:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n  But to return to the space of the faade which, turning from the straight, was\\n  supported against the Palazzo degli Spini. In it was seen, painted in\\n  chiaroscuro, a Nymph all unadorned and little less than nude, placed between\\n  many new kinds of animals, who stood for the new land of Peru, with the other\\n  new West Indies, discovered and ruled for the most part under the auspices of\\n  the most fortunate House of Austria.<a\\n    href=\\\"#_edn14\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_ednref14\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    >[14]</a\\n  >\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>\\n  The recognition of the existence of a fourth part of the world, equal and\\n  separated from the other continents, does not stop Vasari from using the word\\n  Ô<i>indiano</i>Õ in and ambiguous and fluid manner, sometimes as a mere\\n  signifier for ÔexoticÕ or ÔforeignÕ, sometimes charged with deeper meanings.\\n  The idea of distance is present in his description of the\\n  <a\\n    href=\\\"https://www.uffizi.it/opere/adorazione-dei-magi-9f5c2075-8e8f-4883-b3ce-62fc6625a2b4#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=1\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\">Adoration of the Magi</a\\n  >\\n  (1496) by Filippino Lippi.

According to the text, on that day Christ\\n  was offered to the adoration of pagans, alluding to his mission as the Savior\\n  of all the people of the world.

And these steps he adorned with very well-designed statues, not being\\n  content with having proved the beauty of his genius in the variety of figures\\n  that are carrying on their backs all those different animals, such as the\\n  figure of an Indian who is wearing a yellow coat, and carrying on his\\n  shoulders a cage drawn in perspective with some parrots both within it and\\n  without, the whole being rarely beautiful; and such, also, as some who are\\n  leading Indian goats, lions, giraffes, panthers, lynxes, and apes, with Moors\\n  and other lovely things of fancy, all grouped in a beautiful manner and\\n  executed divinely well in fresco<a href=\\\"#_edn16\\\" name=\\\"_ednref16\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\\n    >[16]</a\\n  >\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The most important element in this passage is the Ô<i>figura</i\\n  ><i> indiana</i>Õ. The choice of these words poses a problem: why is Vasari\\n  referring to this figure as ÔIndianÕ? The man is seen from the back, his face\\n  is not visible; apparently there is nothing that would explain this unusual\\n  characterization. A closer observation, however, will offer some details that\\n  could clarify the problem. The figure is wearing pants, traditionally\\n  associated with an Oriental or Barbaric fashion (especially in an Ancient\\n  Roman setting); the mention of the yellow cloak could provide another\\n  explanation if we read it as a reference to the pigment <i>giallo</i\\n  ><i> indiano</i>. All these reasons, however, seem feeble, especially if we\\n  consider that the scene represents Caesar receiving a tribute from foreign\\n  ambassadors, <a href=\\\"#_edn17\\\" name=\\\"_ednref17\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[17]</a> therefore\\n  justifying the presence of not one, but many, ÒIndians.Ó The text could help\\n  us understand: Vasari describes the figure focusing the attention on two\\n  elements: the yellow cloak and the cage with parrots that he is carrying. (On\\n  parrots, see the entry by\\n  <a href=\\\"http://ifaresearch.org/amerasia/lipsman-parrots.\\\"> Claire Lipsman</a\\n  >.) The cage is filled with numerous birds, most likely coming from different\\n  parts of the globe, and is crowned by a magnificent, brightly colored\\n  specimen. Although not depicted from life, the disposition and color of the\\n  feathers and the form of the beak seem to suggest an identification with the\\n  Scarlet Macaw (Ara Macao), native to the Amazon region. The inclusion of an\\n  unmistakably American parrot reveals that Andrea Del Sarto deliberately chose\\n  to reference the New World in this work in order to show that people from\\n  every corner of the Earth, even from the most remote ones, came to pay tribute\\n  to Caesar, and metaphorically to the Medici.\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn18\\\" name=\\\"_ednref18\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[18]</a> The placement of the\\n  figure on the extreme left of the fresco, just as the Americas were ÒplacedÓ\\n  on the extreme ÒleftÓ of Europe, seems to confirm this hypothesis. It is\\n  important to note that Del SartoÕs work on painting the scene does not extend\\n  beyond the figure of Caesar; the right side of the fresco was completed in\\n  1585 by Alessandro Allori. The later addition perhaps altered the balance of\\n  the original composition, enclosed between two very well-defined extremes:\\n  almost Columns of Hercules, the Ô<i>figura</i><i> indiana</i>Õ and Caesar\\n  serve as pillars; the New World on one side, open and unknown, and, on the\\n  other side, the embodiment of Rome, the classical center of the world, ideally\\n  replaced by Florence in the Renaissance. This symbolic system is perfectly\\n  understood by Vasari, who participates in the iconographical game by calling\\n  the figure ÔIndianÕ.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Other sixteenth century authors, such as Ariosto and Tasso, follow a similar\\n  trend. The <i>Orlando Furioso </i>and the <i>Gerusalemme</i\\n  ><i> Liberata</i> represent two more examples of the problem of awareness. In\\n  canto 15 of the <i>Orlando</i>, in a tribute to Charles V and his global\\n  empire, Ariosto elevates CortŽs to immortal glory and, in an epic parallel,\\n  Tasso uses his own canto 15 to honor Columbus as one of the most illustrious\\n  men of his time. The grand encomia paid to the protagonists of the age of\\n  exploration prove the interest of Italian intellectuals in the matters of the\\n  New World, but the disjunction of historical events and linguistic tendencies\\n  is evident in their use of the word Ô<i>indiano</i><i>.</i>Õ TassoÕs\\n  narration, in particular, is set in an era which could have not been further\\n  from the problem of India, and yet he celebrates Columbus, while referring to\\n  Muslim generals and knights as Ô<i>indiano</i>Õ. The word here is a synonym of\\n  infidel, but in the great praise paid to the courage of the Ô<i>fero</i\\n  ><i> indioÕ </i> Adrasto it is free of any negative connotation.\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn19\\\" name=\\\"_ednref19\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[19]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Along the same lines, sixteenth and seventeenth century inventories of\\n  Venetian, Bolognese and Florentine collections confirm the\\n  historical-philological incoherence and the persistence of the idea of\\n  Amerasia in the Italian language. In the inventories of the Medici collection,\\n  for instance, the terms Ô<i>indiano</i>Õ, Ô<i>allÕindiana</i\\n  ><i>Õ, ÔdellÕIndiaÕ </i>were alternatively used to denote objects from\\n  America, Asia, Africa, thus encompassing many things exotic or foreign. Mixtec\\n  masks Ô<i>allÕindiana</i>Õ, feather robes Ô<i>dellÕIndia</i>Õ were displayed\\n  together with Asian artifacts in CosimoÕs Guardaroba, the same one described\\n  by Vasari as a representation of the whole world. The same happens in\\n  Bolognese and Venetian collections, from the case of Ulisse Aldovrandi and his\\n  indiscriminate use of Indian and American terms, to the mention of Ôa lizard,\\n  or another animal from America, the newly rediscovered part of the worldÕused\\n  in combination with Ô<i>indiano</i><i>Õ </i>or Ô<i>delle</i><i> IndieÕ </i>in\\n  the <i>Inventario</i>of Andrea Mantova Benavides (1695).\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn20\\\" name=\\\"_ednref20\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[20]</a> (On the Florentine Codex\\n  owned by Ferdinando I de Medici, see the entry by\\n  <a href=\\\"http://ifaresearch.org/amerasia/raitt-florentinecodex\\\">\\n    Louisa Raitt.</a\\n  >)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To observe\\n  the occurrence of this phenomenon in visual arts, we can turn to Germany.\\n  Albrecht AltdorferÕs <i>Christ Crowned with Thorns</i> (1518), part of the\\n  <i>Saint Sebastian Altar, </i>is a parallel to VasariÕs textual fluidity in\\n  the realm of images. The background of the painting shows a secondary scene,<a\\n    href=\\\"#_edn21\\\"\\n    name=\\\"_ednref21\\\"\\n    title=\\\"\\\"\\n    >[21]</a\\n  >\\n  characterized by the odd presence of a figure that can be easily identified as\\n  an Amerindian, from the feather headdress to the partial nudity and the club\\n  resting on his shoulder. The presence of this Indian, at first rather bizarre,\\n  could be explained by the fact that the scene is set in the Holy Land, a place\\n  east of Europe, and it represents episodes from the Passion of Christ. A\\n  character native to the most remote place on Earth, possibly pagan and\\n  infidel, could help us put a distance between our Christian Europe and the\\n  barbarous actions perpetrated against Christ.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Altdorfer is also an interesting figure, since his case shares many\\n  similarities with VasariÕs. Both artists worked in an environment strongly\\n  fascinated with the New World: in Florence, the Medici were collecting\\n  American artefacts, just as was happening in Augsburg. The Florentine\\n  infatuation with the Americas developed during the course of the sixteenth\\n  century, taking the form of Ludovico ButiÕs frescoes in the Uffizi, or that of\\n  the Thornton expedition in the seventeenth century. (On the Buti frescoes, see\\n  the essay\\n  <a href=\\\"http://ifaresearch.org/amerasia/weitzman-armeria.\\\">Margo Weitzman.</a\\n  >) The Northern artists did not remain indifferent: the interest of artists\\n  such as DŸrer and Burkmair (part of the same circle of Altdorfer) is evident\\n  in their drawings and illustrations, and the\\n  <i>Triumph of Maximilian I</i> (1518) could be considered the final phase of\\n  the evolution of this interest. The\\n  <a href=\\\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/431769\\\"\\n   target=\\\"_blank\\\" >People of Calicut</a\\n  >, part of the procession in honor of the Emperor in the <i>Triumphs,</i> are\\n  the representation of this culture of exchanges, symbolizing at the same time\\n  the notions of extremities and fusion in a propagandistic and celebratory\\n  context. Expressly depicting Asian populations,\\n  <a href=\\\"#_edn22\\\" name=\\\"_ednref22\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[22]</a> they are characterized by\\n  a mixture of feather headdresses, Brazilian clubs and elephants, becoming the\\n  perfect embodiment of this combination of Asia and America, historical\\n  awareness and linguistic neglect.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  In conclusion, Ô<i>indiano</i>Õ and <i>ÔIndia</i>Õ were extremely ambiguous\\n  terms in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. They could acquire positive\\n  connotations or negative meanings, allude to distant and wealthy lands while\\n  hinting at familiar notions; they could refer to infidel savages and at the\\n  same time denote precious and luxurious product. The continuous use of these\\n  words in an undefined and malleable manner perfectly shows how, after more\\n  than five centuries, the mentality of Amerasia survives in our everyday\\n  language.\\n</p>\\n\\n<br clear=\\\"all\\\" />\\n<hr>\\n<div id=\\\"edn1\\\">\\n  <p class=\\\"Footnote\\\">\\n    <a href=\\\"#_ednref1\\\" name=\\\"_edn1\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[1]</a> See Dante, Purg.VII.74.\\n    <i>Oro e argento fine, e cocco, e biacca, indico legno lucido, e sereno</i>.\\n  </p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\\\"edn2\\\">\\n  <p class=\\\"Footnote\\\">\\n    <a href=\\\"#_ednref2\\\" name=\\\"_edn2\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[2]</a> From a linguistic point of\\n    view, Dante provides a helpful example. Purg.VII.74 poses a series of\\n    problems of interpretation. Scholars usually identify <i>indico </i>with\\n    <i>indaco</i> (the blue pigment), but some propose that the words\\n    <i>indico</i> and <i>legno</i> should be read together, therefore indicating\\n    ebony (see Virgil, <i>Sola India nigrum fert hebanum</i>, Georg.II). Ebony\\n    is a type of wood typical of Ethiopia, as well as Asian regions such as\\n    Indochina and Sri Lanka. If we accept the second interpretation, this could\\n    exemplify the persistence of an India-Ethiopia overlap in the languages of\\n    12th century Italy.

In the region of the map\\n    labelled Hispania Nova (New Spain), we find Temixtitan (Tenochtitlan, Mexico City) due east of Mangi (Manzi, or\\n    Southern China) and southeast of Chatay (Cathay, or Northern China), with a Messigo (Mexico) to the west of Mangi\\n    and a smattering of cities ending in <i>fu</i> (a Chinese administrative division signifying “prefecture”) in the\\n    same general region as identifiably Mesoamerican place names like Aculuacan (Acolhuacan), all within the lands of\\n    Asia Magna (Greater Asia) and bordered on the east by what is now known as the Gulf of Mexico but that here is\\n    labelled Mare Cathayum (“Sea of Cathay”). Vopel’s assertive amalgamation of the newly discovered territories with\\n    legendary Asian sites may reflect his interest in promoting the idea that Chinese lands fell well within the\\n    territories of the Spanish Crown, as opposed to those of Portugal, a notion reinforced by his claim to that effect\\n    in one of the explanatory cartouches that identifies Moctezuma, the ruler of Tenochtitlan, with the Great Khan\\n    (“Themixitian magni Chan Imperatoris alias Montis Zuma”).<a href=\\\"#_edn1\\\"\\n                                                                name=\\\"_ednref1\\\"\\n                                                                title=\\\"\\\"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>\\n<p>            Regardless of Vopel’s geopolitical thesis, it is worth considering whether his contemporaries would find\\n    this imbrication of China and Mexico as jarring as it is to us.

Though one may lament Foucault’s having missed an opportunity to explore the\\n    intellectual ramifications of European exploration and colonization in Africa, Asia and the Americas, his omission\\n    is perhaps not entirely surprising, given the concerted efforts European thinkers made during the two centuries\\n    after Columbus’s voyages to assimilate a “new world” into the preexisting hermeneutic schemas that had developed as\\n    part of the complex architecture of late medieval and early modern epistemologies.</p>\\n<p>            The present essay considers one instance of such an assimilation—one that is tied to the domain of books\\n    and writing, which, as Foucault points out, was privileged over orality in pre- and early modern\\n    epistemologies.<a href=\\\"#_edn8\\\"\\n                      name=\\\"_ednref8\\\"\\n                      title=\\\"\\\"><sup>[8]</sup></a> The European reception and interpretation of the few surviving\\n    pre-Columbian indigenous manuscripts and of pictographic writing and illustrations in post-conquest codices prepared\\n    under the watchful eye of missionaries reflects this primacy of the written word and encouraged the incorporation of\\n    indigenous American writing systems within a larger narrative of the Biblical “confusion of tongues” in the episode\\n    of the Tower of Babel, with <i>written</i> words understood to be the underlying form of language, and all writing,\\n    however far removed from its origins before Babel, darkly mirroring the words in the “book of Creation.” Attempts to\\n    understand Mesoamerican manuscripts can be tied to two intellectual currents, both of which emerged out of\\n    traditions of esotericism: on the one hand, the images found in emblem books and, on the other, inquiries into the\\n    history of human languages. Both currents informed European scholars’ interest in Egyptian hieroglyphs and other\\n    written manifestations of ancient languages; both are tied to a fundamentally visual or scriptural conception of\\n    language as a mysterious chain of resemblances linking words to things; both depend on allegorical modes of thought\\n    according to which a single image can encompass a complex statement.</p>\\n<p>            Europeans who scrutinized these Mesoamerican manuscripts evidently understood the images and pictographs\\n    to be “hieroglyphs”—a not unreasonable supposition—though what exactly was meant by this term deserves some\\n    unpacking, especially because they seem to have interpreted not just the pictographs proper as hieroglyphs but also\\n    what are in fact images of deities and rulers. The term itself emerged in the context of the discovery in 1419 of a\\n    treatise from late Antiquity on Egyptian symbolic writing, the <i>Hieroglyphica</i> attributed to a certain\\n    Horapollo (a Hellenized compound of Horus Apollo), and the circulation of that text among Italian humanists in the\\n    fifteenth century. Renaissance fascination with Egyptian monumental inscriptions was further encouraged by the\\n    contemporary excavation in Rome of sculptures and obelisks bearing hieroglyphics.<a href=\\\"#_edn9\\\"\\n                                                                                        name=\\\"_ednref9\\\"\\n                                                                                        title=\\\"\\\"><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>\\n<p>            Though Horapollo was no Rosetta Stone, and Europeans remained fundamentally in the dark regarding\\n    Egyptian writing until 1799, speculation on the meaning of such inscriptions led to inventive “hieroglyphs” of the\\n    sort that appear in Francesco Colonna’s <i>Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</i> (Venice, 1499), like the famous emblem that\\n    its printer, Aldus Manutius, adopted as his own device and motto, the dolphin-entwined anchor signifying “festina\\n    tarde” (or “lente,” hasten slowly), paired with another emblem, a helmet, an ox-skull, and an oil lamp representing\\n    the idea that “Patience is the ornament, guardian and protector of life” [fig. 2]. A rough genealogy may be drawn\\n    from Colonna through Andrea Alciato’s moralizing interpretations of emblems in his <i>Emblematum liber</i>\\n    (Augsburg, 1531) and Pierio Valeriano’s voluminous exegesis of allegorical figures based on commentaries on\\n    Horapollo, <i>Hieroglyphica sive de sacris Aegyptiorum literis commentarii</i> (Basel, 1556), to the most emblematic\\n    of emblem books, Cesare Ripa’s <i>Iconologia</i>, published initially without illustrations in Rome in 1593 but soon\\n    reissued in 1603 with a substantial catalogue of accompanying woodcuts whose number continued to grow in two\\n    subsequent re-editions before the author’s death in 1622 [figs. 3-5]. Each of these books present complex images\\n    that today could never be confused with hieroglyphs, though the title of Valeriano’s work makes it clear that the\\n    term could be plausibly applied to such images in the sixteenth century. Each emblem, furthermore, is accompanied by\\n    elaborate exegeses suggesting that, in accordance with the contemporary understanding of Egyptian hieroglyphs, the\\n    images themselves were shorthand for entire complexes of ideas.</p>\\n<p>            In this light, Lorenzo Legati’s attempt in the expanded catalogue of the Cospi collection at\\n    understanding the images and pictographs in the <i>Codex Cospi</i>—if not their semantic content, at least their\\n    function—becomes clearer. His description of the manuscript, following an account of its size and accordion-book\\n    format (“non è diviso in fogli, come i nostri libri”—it is not divided into leaves, like our books), indicates that\\n    the book contains “only HIEROGLYPHS from MEXICO, which are very extravagant figures that for the most part portray\\n    strangely monstrous humans and animals” [fig. 6].<a href=\\\"#_edn10\\\"\\n                                                        name=\\\"_ednref10\\\"\\n                                                        title=\\\"\\\"><sup>[10]</sup></a> These he divides into various\\n    categories, by size: “massimi,” “mediocri,” “menori,” and “minimi.” The penultimate class are arranged in “marginal\\n    compartments, as if they were (and perhaps they are) marginal notes or commentary on the larger hieroglyphs,” and\\n    the last “likewise seem to explain the largest hieroglyphs, which they surround like a crown.”<a href=\\\"#_edn11\\\"\\n                                                                                                     name=\\\"_ednref11\\\"\\n                                                                                                     title=\\\"\\\"><sup>[11]</sup></a>\\n    Though Legati fails to find an analogous book form for the manuscript, he does intuit an analogy for the small\\n    pictographs around the margins (marginal notes or commentaries) and situates the pictographs and illustrations in\\n    the general category of hieroglyphs, presumably on an Egyptian model—or, rather, on a model that encompassed also\\n    the elaborate allegories in emblem books, conflating those figures with Egyptian hieroglyphs as they were understood\\n    by European savants. The examples he provides include an image of the Lord of the House of Dawn,\\n    Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli (the planet Venus), and a throne, both <i>geroglifici massimi</i> in Legati’s classification.\\n    The woodcut in the catalogue fails, however, to reflect the fact that this image is a narrative scene in the\\n    original manuscript, with the fearsome god attacking the throne with his spear. In Legati’s catalogue, the figure\\n    has been reversed, suggesting that he has interpreted each element as a separate “hieroglyph” [fig. 7; cf. fig. 8].\\n</p>\\n<p>            The description of the “Mexican book” appears in the second chapter of the third book of Legati’s full\\n    catalogue of the Cospi collection, under the rubric of  “Libri, Volume, Carte, e Scritture Esotiche” (Books,\\n    volumes, documents, and esoteric writings). Here there are various books and ink drawings from China (immediately\\n    preceding our erstwhile “Chinese” book, now catalogued as “Mexican”). Legati refers to Chinese characters as such\\n    (<i>caratteri</i>) and not as hieroglyphs, but he does cite at length the humanist and historiographer Cosimo\\n    Bartoli (1503–1572), who, after explaining that each character represents a word and that they would be better\\n    described as “cifere” (ciphers), compares Chinese characters to Egyptian hieroglyphs: they are “ingenious work,\\n    perhaps even more witty than Egyptian hieroglyphs.”<a href=\\\"#_edn12\\\"\\n                                                          name=\\\"_ednref12\\\"\\n                                                          title=\\\"\\\"><sup>[12]</sup></a> Legati notes that the Chinese\\n    write with a brush, not a pen, something he also draws our attention to in the description of the Mexican book:\\n    “fatture non della Penna, mà del Pennello.”<a href=\\\"#_edn13\\\"\\n                                                  name=\\\"_ednref13\\\"\\n                                                  title=\\\"\\\"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>\\n<p>            We lack even an approximate date for the creation of the <i>Codex Cospi</i>, but the style of the images\\n    and pictographs as well as the book’s folded format reflect a decidedly pre-Columbian tradition, even if it might\\n    have been prepared during the early years of the conquest of Mexico.<a href=\\\"#_edn14\\\"\\n                                                                           name=\\\"_ednref14\\\"\\n                                                                           title=\\\"\\\"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Following the\\n    conquest, missionaries working in the Spanish colonies oversaw the production of newfangled books by indigenous\\n    informants, scribes, and painters—European-style codices proper, with hinges at the spine—whose imagery likewise\\n    reflected the influence of European draftsmanship while conserving fundamental aspects of Mesoamerican pictographic\\n    conventions. One such document is the so-called <i>Codex Mendoza</i>, perhaps commissioned by the first viceroy of\\n    New Spain, Antonio de Mendoza (thus its conventional name) and in all likelihood prepared during his administration\\n    (1535–1550). It represents in its first pages a pictorial history of the founding of Tenochtitlán and the reign of\\n    its first ruler, followed by an accounting of the tributes from conquered territories paid to the Mexica rulers of\\n    that city [fig. 9]. The last page of the manuscript explains that it was intended to be sent on to Spain. It somehow\\n    came into the possession of André Thevet, appointed royal cosmographer to Henri II of France around 1553, and his\\n    signature appears in several places on the manuscript.<a href=\\\"#_edn15\\\"\\n                                                             name=\\\"_ednref15\\\"\\n                                                             title=\\\"\\\"><sup>[15]</sup></a> Thevet referred to\\n    Mesoamerican books in his possession in his own writings and did not hesitate to compare the pictographs and figures\\n    with Egyptian hieroglyphs, though he wavers in his terminology, also recalling Legati’s description of Chinese\\n    writing:</p>\\n<blockquote>the Mexicans, in order to express their ideas, use characters resembling diverse terrestrial and aquatic\\n    animals and the head, feet, arms, and other limbs of a man, just as the Egyptians and Ethiopians did formerly in\\n    their hieroglyphic letters…. Two such books I have by me, written by hand in the city of Themistitan, and filled\\n    with their characters and figures and the interpretations of them.<a href=\\\"#_edn16\\\"\\n                                                                         name=\\\"_ednref16\\\"\\n                                                                         title=\\\"\\\"><sup>[16]</sup></a></blockquote>\\n\\n<p>            When Thevet died, Richard Hakluyt acquired the manuscript, and upon his passing bequeathed it to Samuel\\n    Purchas, who published a woodcut reproduction of fol. 2 in his <i>Hakluytus posthumus, or, Purchas his Pilgrimes</i>\\n    (London, 1625) [fig. 10]. This image was in turn copied in a work that brings us full circle, back to the\\n    esotericism of Renaissance exegetes of <i>emblemata</i>, hieroglyphs, and Hermetic and Kabbalistic texts (and to the\\n    logic of Foucault’s episteme founded on the principle of similitudes), with the figure of the Jesuit polymath\\n    Athanasius Kircher, the <i>summum</i> of that tradition as it had developed in the seventeenth century and perhaps\\n    also its last gasp.</p>\\n<p>            Kircher included the copy of Purchas’s woodcut of the <i>Codex Mendoza</i> in the last volume of his <i>Oedipus\\n    Aegyptiacus</i> (Rome, 1652–54) [fig. 11]. This work was the culmination of his studies in ancient languages leading\\n    to his fanciful and quasi-mystical interpretation of Egyptian hieroglyphics and a reaffirmation of his thesis that\\n    Egyptian writing (and wisdom and religion) provided the ancient foundations for that of the Indians, the East Asians\\n    and even the Americans, however distorted and debased that original writing and wisdom had become through the\\n    process of its dissemination in Antiquity. Or, as he put it in the work where he first formulated the thesis\\n    extensively, <i>Prodromus Coptus sive Aegyptiacus</i> (Coptic or Egyptian Precursor), published in Rome in 1636,\\n    “Egypt was the nursery not only of the progress of the Christian religion in distant lands, but also of all the\\n    superstitions propagated to the world at every time.”<a href=\\\"#_edn17\\\"\\n                                                            name=\\\"_ednref17\\\"\\n                                                            title=\\\"\\\"><sup>[17]</sup></a> The Apostles, in spreading the\\n    gospel of Christ throughout the world, had simply followed the same routes taken by the priests of ancient Egypt.\\n    Kircher’s vision of language, history, and theology entails some fundamental affinity or similarity spanning a vast\\n    swath of lands and peoples, from North Africa, across Asia, and into the Americas: “India” writ large, in other\\n    words, from the “India Maior Aethiopiae” (Greater India of Ethiopia) on Vopel’s map, through “India intra Gangem”\\n    and “India extra Gangem,” all the way to “India Orientalis” and the lands of the Mexica. Even if maps included in\\n    Kircher’s publications depict a wide Pacific Ocean (or <i>Mare Australe</i>) and a strait between eastern Siberia\\n    and Alaska, conceptually at least these territories were effectively contiguous.</p>\\n<p>            Thus, while Mexican temples might lend themselves to easy comparison with Egyptian pyramids, as in\\n    Kircher’s discussion of the temple of Huitzilopochtli in a chapter of <i>Oedipus Aegyptiacus</i> titled “De\\n    religione Americanorum Aegyptiacae parallela” (On the religion of the Americans, a parallel of the Egyptian) [fig.\\n    12], Asian pagodas do not. Nevertheless, he presents them as “pyramids” as well in his <i>China illustrata</i>\\n    (Amsterdam, 1667) and correspondingly distorts their representation to confirm their allegedly Egyptian origin and\\n    thereby supply further evidence for the Egyptian roots of Chinese religion [fig. 13].<a\\n            href=\\\"#_edn18\\\"\\n            name=\\\"_ednref18\\\"\\n            title=\\\"\\\"><sup>[18]</sup></a> Kircher makes a similar move in his treatment of Asian writing systems. In the\\n    series of encomia to Ferdinand III of Austria composed in dozens of different languages and scripts at the beginning\\n    of <i>Oedipus Aegyptiacus</i>, Kircher includes one purporting to be in Brahmi script, which he calls “lingua\\n    hieroglyphica Brachmanum” (hieroglyphic language of the Brahmans). And the origin of Chinese characters, or <i>characteres\\n        hieroglyphici Sinensium</i>, is likewise Egyptian according to his <i>China illustrata</i>: “The ancient\\n    Chinese…followed the Egyptians, from whom they are descended: they executed their writing not by a composition of\\n    letters but by figures constructed from various natural things,” such as the characters he claims are derived from\\n    images of birds [fig. 14].<a href=\\\"#_edn19\\\"\\n                                 name=\\\"_ednref19\\\"\\n                                 title=\\\"\\\"><sup>[19]</sup></a> In any case, Kircher explicitly states his overarching\\n    thesis at the very beginning of this section of <i>China illustrata</i>, “De Sinensium literatura” (On Chinese\\n    literature), regarding the peoples of the world who use non-alphabetic writing systems, or <i>characteres\\n        significativi</i>: “It is certain that three nations, before all other peoples of the world, made use of these\\n    [characters], namely, the Chinese, the Brahmans, and the Mexicans.”<a\\n            href=\\\"#_edn20\\\"\\n            name=\\\"_ednref20\\\"\\n            title=\\\"\\\"><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>\\n<p>            However much the accuracy of seventeenth-century maps had improved over Vopel’s vision of the world,\\n    Kircher’s works suggest that, in certain corners at least, the underlying principles behind Vopel’s organization of\\n    geography remained in force. Asia and America might well have become clearly delineated continents, but they were\\n    part of a world in which the dream of recovering a universal, Adamic language—one that preserved a direct\\n    correspondence between words and things—was still conceivable, for its traces were retrievable in the visual echoes\\n    of the scripts of ancient and modern languages. This is the ethos evoked in an engraving by Zacharias Dolendo after\\n    a design by Karel van Mander printed in the last years of the sixteenth century depicting the confusion of tongues\\n    and peoples after work stopped on the Tower of Babel [fig. 15]. In the foreground, groups of figures carry or hold\\n    three tablets, each bearing different alphabets, Hebrew, Greek, and Arabic. In the distance, hieroglyphics can be\\n    made out faintly on an obelisk [fig. 16].<a href=\\\"#_edn21\\\"\\n                                                name=\\\"_ednref21\\\"\\n                                                title=\\\"\\\"><sup>[21]</sup></a> Incongruously for a modern viewer, the\\n    group with the Arabic tablet are naked save for loincloths and headdresses; one wears the stereotypical East Indian\\n    or Amerindian feather headdress [fig. 17].

Nagel</b>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Studies devoted to the New World discoveries routinely acknowledge that Europeans confused the Americas with\n          Asia well into the sixteenth century, but no study has ever focused specifically on this confusion and its\n          broader implications. Early modern European cartographers, writers, editors, and artists systematically\n          blurred Asia and the Americas, placing Asian ports in Latin America, Marco Polo`s lions and tigers in Canada,\n          and identifying Aztec temples as mosques. We propose that the confusion evident in the cartographic record\n          needs to be understood in relation to a wide array of texts and images, all of which we will consider as maps\n          of different sorts. These confusions pose a fundamental methodological challenge, making it necessary to\n          suspend the definition of the words “America,” “Asia,” and even mutual redefinition. To take the confusion\n          seriously is to resist imposing later cartographic and cultural definitions on the earlier period, and to\n          re-imagine a proximity of thinking and discovery connecting one to the other. It is tempting to say that in\n          the early modern global movement of people, commodities, ideas, and images, ideas about Asia influenced\n          representations of the Americas, and (a less familiar hypothesis) ideas about the New World also influenced\n          representations of Asia. But the challenge is precisely not to frame the problem in such a way that America on\n          one side and Asia on the other. When a Tupinamba king appears in a scene of the Adoration of the Magi, the\n          challenge is to see it not as a strange intrusion of “New World” information into traditional iconography, but\n          rather as an instance of expanding eastern imaginary incorporating evidence from the most recent discoveries—a\n          malleable situation also evident in contemporary cartographic representations.\n        </p>\n        <h3>The Website</h3>\n        <p>\n          The website is composed primarily of an interactive high definition map.
