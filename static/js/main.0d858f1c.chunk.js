It is necessary to observe that Vopel has split Java into Java major\n    and minor, further, he has split these two islands so that the eastern half of\n    both islands is visible on the left edge of the map, and the western half of\n    both islands is visible on the right edge of the map. Though it did not\n    produce any spices per se, it had been an entrep\xf4t for the global spice trade\n    for centuries before Vopel made his map. We can see its Amerasian nature in a\n    variety of examples. For instance, writing to his colleague Domenico Malipiero\n    in 1501, the Venetian ambassador to Lisbon, Angelo Trevisan, stated that he\n    believed newly discovered island of Jamaica was Java.<a\n        href="#_edn1"\n        name="_ednref1"\n>[1]</a\n>\n    In the middle of the sixteenth century, the cosmographer Sebastian M\xfcnster\n    visually underscored the continuity of the Asian archipelago with the islands\n    of the Americas by employing the same print of cannibalism to illustrate daily\n    life in both Java and the Caribbean in his Cosmographia (1550).<a\n        href="#_edn2"\n        name="_ednref2"\n>[2]</a\n>\n</p>\n\n<img\n        width="100%"\n        src="vopel-images/iava.jpg"\n        alt="canibals chopping body into parts"\n/>\n\n<div id="edn1">\n    <p>\n        <a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[1]</a>\n        \u201c[Columbus] zonse a una insula chiamata da li paesani Iamaica, ma, come lui\n        dice, da li cosmografi Ianna maior,\u201d in\n        <em>Fonti italiane per la storia della scoperta del nuovo mondo</em>, ed.\n        Guglielmo Berchet, 2 vols.

Both these hemispheric maps and the main map are\n    clearly marked by five latitude divisions (painted in red both here and on the\n    large map below) that serve to divide the world up into five climatic zones,\n    or <em>climata</em>, a system of organizing the world\u2019s regions developed by\n    ancient geographers going back at least to Parmenides and most influentially\n    expounded by the fifth-century CE writer Macrobius in his\n    <em>Commentary on Scipio\u2019s Dream</em>. Above the arctic and below the\n    antarctic circles are two frigid zones, regions of excessive cold that cannot\n    support life. Between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn on either side of\n    the equator is the torrid zone, a region of raging heat that, according to\n    Parmenides and then Macrobius\u2019s many medieval readers, was also inhospitable\n    to life and uninhabited. Between the torrid and frigid zones are the temperate\n    zones, the inhabited and civilized parts of the world. The known inhabited\n    world was in the northern temperate zone, leaving it a matter of speculation\n    whether in the antipodes there were parallel civilizations as yet unknown.\n    Along the left edge of the Vopel map we see each of these zones clearly\n    labeled along the appropriate latitudes. Nicol\xe1s Wey G\xf3mez showed that this\n    thinking about latitude rather than longitude directly motivated Columbus\u2019s\n    observations. Columbus had set out to discover the equatorial torrid zone to\n    prove, among other things, that they were temperate and habitable. The\n    discovery that the tropics were in fact fertile and inhabited made possible\n    descriptions of the Caribbean and its people that corresponded in many ways to\n    descriptions of India, thought to occupy the same latitude.<a\n        href="#_edn1"\n        name="_ednref1"\n>[1]</a\n>\n</p>\n<p>\n    The two hemispheric maps are flanked by portraits of significant cosmographers\n    of Antiquity. On either side of the Western Hemisphere with the New World are\n    Solinus and Strabo; on either side of the Eastern Hemisphere with Europe,\n    Africa, and most of Asia are Pomponius Mela and Ptolemy. In 1520 Peter Apianus\n    published a world map that closely followed Waldseem\xfcller\u2019s 1507 map, with its\n    representation of the New World and a landmass labeled America. Apianus, a\n    cosmographer celebrated by the Emperor Charles V was a significant\n    precursor for Vopel. As the influential Apianus 1520 map was published\n    together with editions of Solinus\u2019 <em>Polyhistor</em> (1520) and of Pomponius\n    Mela\u2019s <em>De Situ Orbis</em> (1522),<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a>\n    it is possible that these associations prompted the inclusion of these two\n    geographers on Vopel\u2019s map, which was intended to be a much updated and more\n    elaborate world map to replace that of Apianus.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The inclusion of the more famous Strabo and Ptolemy hardly requires\n    explanation, though their placement in relation to the hemispheres is telling.\n    Strabo is appropriately placed closest to the latest New World lands, a\n    position appropriate for one who had argued that the geographer need only\n    represent those places known to him, without needing to connect the dots into\n    closed entities such as a singular world island. An open geographical system,\n    he proposed, would make clearer the limits of knowledge of the world and the\n    fact that knowledge of the farthest lands would develop. Strabo also rejected\n    the Parmenidean idea that the torrid zone was uninhabitable, proposing that it\n    was temperate, fertile, and inhabited, an alternative tradition that gained\n    increasing acceptance in the later Middle Ages in the West and ultimately\n    informed Columbus\u2019 effort to test the theory.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3"\n>[3]</a\n>\n    It is therefore appropriate that Strabo holds the globe at this edge, turning\n    to look at the latest discoveries, while Ptolemy is placed at the other side,\n    near the part of Asia that he had considered to be the limit of the inhabited\n    world.\n</p>\n\n<div id="edn1">\n    <p>\n        <a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[1]</a> Nicol\xe1s Wey G\xf3mez,\n        <em>The Tropics of Empire: Why Columbus Sailed South to the Indies</em>\n        (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2008).\n    </p>\n</div>\n\n<div id="edn2">\n    <p>\n        <a href="#_ednref2" name="_edn2" title="">[2]</a> Donald McGuirk, \u201cThe 1520\n        Apianus World Map; History, World Census and Comparison with the\n        Waldseem\xfcller 1507 World Map,\u201d <em>The Portolan Journal</em> 77 (2010):\n        26-36.\n    </p>\n</div>\n\n<div id="edn3">\n    <p>\n        <a href="#_ednref3" name="_edn3" title="">[3]</a> On Strabo\u2019s geographical\n        conceptions and their influence on New World exploration, see Nicol\xe1s Wey\n        G\xf3mez,\n        <em>The Tropics of Empire: Why Columbus Sailed South to the Indies</em>\n        (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2008), 187 and 233-34.\n    </p>\n</div>\n'},function(e,n){e.exports='<h1>Ophir displaced</h1>\n<h2>Vittoria Riccio</h2>\n<p>\n    In his <i>Lettera rarissima</i>, written on July 7 1503, Christopher Columbus\n    proclaimed to the King and Queen of Spain, "Gold is most excellent.

The Admiral, however, was undeniably\n    inspired by a profound religious sentiment; his voyages were not only\n    motivated by a desire for geographical or political expansion, but also by a\n    quest to confirm the Biblical text. The <i>Lettera</i> of 1503 is a\n    fundamental document in the Columbian corpus, not only as a detailed source on\n    his travel, but also as a testimony of the role of sacred scripture in his\n    understanding of the world. The last section of this letter, in fact, is\n    dedicated to the mythical land of Ophir and the gold of King Solomon,\n    illuminating the nature of a mission that fused together a quest for riches,\n    exploration, and salvific benefits. While Ophir shows up on Vopel\'s map in its\n    most eastern realms, its relevance trickles over to the Amerasian continent in\n    terms of sixteenth-century perceptions of its meaning. From the annihilation\n    of the great Central American empires to the emergence of myths and tales on\n    golden men and cities, the European conception of the New World was inevitably\n    shaped by visions of gold, which were embodied by Ophir and those who sought\n    out this mythical location in the Americas.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Famous for its wealth, Ophir was the region from which King Solomon received a\n    cargo of gold, silver, sandalwood, pearls, ivory, apes and peacocks every\n    three years (1 Kings 9:28 and 10:22). In the first quarter of the sixteenth\n    century, European cosmographers began to identify Ophir with Hispaniola (link\n    to <a href="#hispaniola-zipanga">Hispaniola entry</a>). Jewish tradition in particular often associated Ophir\n    with a place in India, and it was surely this Indian location that allowed\n    Ophir\'s placement to elide into the Americas.<a\n        href="#_edn3"\n        name="_ednref3"\n        title=""\n>[3]</a\n>\n    As we shall see, generations of cosmographers and antiquarians continued to\n    try to determine Ophir\'s exact location, well into the early modern period,\n    placing it at times in Africa, India and the Americas, and often in Peru.<a\n        href="#_edn4"\n        name="_ednref4"\n        title=""\n>[4]</a\n>\n</p>\n<p>\n    The Hebrew Bible associated Ophir and Tarsis (Tharsis, Tarshish) (link to\n    <a href="#tharsis">Tharsis entry</a>). They are both mentioned in the Genesis as the progeny of Noah:\n    Ophir, the eleventh of Ioctan\'s thirteen sons, descends from Shem (Gen. 10:29\n    <i>et seq</i>.) and Tarsis, son of Iavan, from Iafet (Gen. 10:4; Chron.\n    1:7).<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a> Ophir is also referred\n    to as a Ioctanite or South-Arabian tribe. These names are found again in the\n    Book of Kings (9:26 <i>et seq.</i>) and in Chronicles (8:17 <i>et seq.</i>) as\n    places of incredible wealth and sources of precious metals, gems and exotic\n    animals. According to the scriptures, King David donated 3,000 talents of\n    Ophir gold for the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem. Later, his son\n    Solomon and King Hiram of Tyro sent their ships to these legendary mines;\n    their fleet sailed every three years from the port of Ezion-Geber in the Red\n    Sea, bringing back to Jerusalem 420 talents of gold<a\n        href="#_edn6"\n        name="_ednref6"\n        title=""\n>[6]</a\n>\n    (I Kings 9:26-28), silver, ivory, apes, peacocks (I Kings 10:22), precious\n    stones and a special variety of wood called <i>almug</i> (I Kings 10:12; II\n    Chron. 2:8; 9:10-11). A hundred years later, King Jehoshaphat"s attempt to\n    reach the golden land of Ophir resulted in failure, his ships wrecked at\n    Ezion-Geber before they could even sail to sea.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The "gold of Ophir" is generally gold of the finest quality, as we read, for\n    instance, in the Book of Job: "It cannot be bought with pure gold; Nor can\n    silver be weighed out in exchange for it. It cannot be bought with gold of\n    Ophir; Nor with rare onyx and sapphire" (Job 28:15, 16). In 1946, a potsherd\n    bearing the inscription "Ophir gold to Bet Horon, thirty shekels" was\n    unearthed in Tell el-Qasileh, north of Tel Aviv, a discovery that demonstrates\n    the wide-ranging association between Ophir and gold, as well as a common\n    knowledge of these lands and their trades with Jerusalem.<a\n        href="#_edn7"\n        name="_ednref7"\n        title=""\n>[7]</a\n>\n    The case of Tarsis is not dissimilar. Tarsis was Jonah\'s destination in his\n    attempted escape from divine commands (Jonah 1:3) and it was known to be a\n    maritime port in the extreme regions of the earth. The idea of remoteness\n    implied in Jonah\'s story and the association with trade are possibly the basis\n    on which a new meaning for the word developed: in many Biblical passages,\n    "ships of Tarsis" are vessels equipped for long-distance travels, not\n    necessarily connected to the city anymore.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Fabled lands of gold, silver and precious gems are not exclusive to the Old\n    Testament; they have populated human imaginary, folklore and epic traditions,\n    throughout the centuries. The first allusion to a golden land appears as early\n    as the fourth century B.C., in the Indian epic poem <i>Ramayana</i>, where we\n    read of the marvelous island and land of gold, respectively called\n    <i>Suvarnadvipa</i> and <i>Suvarnabhumi</i>. In Chinese ancient literature, we\n    find mentions of a magnificent region of gold known as <i>Jin-Lin</i>, the\n    "Golden Neighbor" or "Golden Border". In the majority of cases, these\n    fantastic and opulent lands were located in Sumatra, Java or Malaysia and in\n    rare instances further East, probably in the area of modern Philippines. The\n    Ancient Greek <i>Chryse</i> and <i>Argyve</i>, the island of gold and its\n    silver pendant, were thought to be not far from India, somewhere at the mouth\n    of the Ganges or beyond the river. In the first century A.D., these two\n    legendary islands are mentioned in authors such as Pomponius Mela and Marinos\n    of Tyro, as well as in the <i>Periplus Mari Erythraei</i>, an anonymous\n    treatise describing navigation routes and trades in the Red Sea and in the\n    Indian Ocean. In his <i>Naturalis Historia</i>, Pliny the Elder discusses the\n    supposed location of the islands, this time situated at the mouth of the Indus\n    River.\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    Beyond the mouth of the Indus are the islands of <i>Chryse</i> and <i>Argyre</i>, abounding\n    in metals, I believe; but as to what some persons have stated, that their soil\n    consists of gold and silver, I am not so willing to believe that.<a\n        href="#_edn8"\n        name="_ednref8"\n        title=""\n>[8]</a\n>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    <i>Chryse</i> and <i>Argyve</i>&#8211;and their Indian location&#8211;are also\n    part of Herodotus" <i>Historiae</i> and Josephus"\n    <i>Antiquitates Judaicae</i>, where for the first time an identification\n    between Ophir and <i>Chryse</i>&#8211;here called <i>Aurea</i>&#8211;is\n    proposed. Finally, Ptolemy in his <i>Geography</i> locates <i>Chryse </i>and\n    <i>Argyve</i> beyond the <i>Chersonesus Aurea</i> ("Golden peninsula"),\n    identified with the present-day Malaysian peninsula. The Western imagination\n    clearly located incredible Oriental wealth on the islands of Southeast Asia.\n    (link to <a href="#archipelagus">Archipelagum entry</a>)\n</p>\n<p>\n    Such thought directly influenced Europeans\' understanding of the lands\n    discovered in the western Atlantic. As we saw, Ancient Greek and Roman writers\n    tended to associate gold and abundance with India; whether it was in relation\n    to <i>Chryse</i> or to the Golden Chersonese, the idea of distance was\n    connected to that of wealth. Herodotus writes:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    It seems as if the extreme regions of the earth were blessed by nature with\n    the most excellent productions, just in the same way that Hellas enjoys a\n    climate more excellently tempered than any other country. In India, which, as\n    I observed lately, is the furthest region of the inhabited world towards the\n    east, all the four-footed beasts and the birds are very much bigger than those\n    found elsewhere, except only the horses, which are surpassed by the Median\n    breed called the Nisaean. Gold too is produced there in vast abundance, some\n    dug from the earth, some washed down by the rivers, some carried off in the\n    mode which I have but now described. And further, there are trees which grow\n    wild there, the fruit whereof is a wool exceeding in beauty and goodness that\n    of sheep. The natives make their clothes of this tree-wool.<a\n        href="#_edn9"\n        name="_ednref9"\n        title=""\n>[9]</a\n>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    Early Christian and Jewish authors, such as Josephus or Jerome, embraced this\n    existing parallel and applied it to biblical exegesis, generating a new\n    current of interpretation that was still alive in the early modern era. An\n    important element in the identification India-Ophir is philology, a tool that\n    also proved to be critical in the New World debate. In the Septuagint and in\n    early commentators, the name of the golden city of Solomon is sometimes\n    transcribed as Sophir or Souphir, terms that were immediately compared with\n    the Indian city of Souppara described by Ptolemy and the Coptic name for\n    India, Sophir. The profusion of gold, silver and gems in the region as well as\n    the presence of animals such as apes and elephants, described in the Bible,\n    provided a further level of confirmation and the mysterious <i>almug</i> wood\n    was interpreted as Indian sandalwood.\n</p>\n<p>\n    When Columbus sailed West, such notions were well ingrained in his thought,\n    and he left Spain in the hopes of reaching Ophir by another route. On the\n    globe created by Martin Behaim in 1492, Ophir is depicted as an island at the\n    mouth of the Ganges. The globe was likely known to the Admiral, and his\n    interest in Ophir is evident in his writings and annotations to authors such\n    as Josephus and Pierre d\'Ailly. As mentioned, before Columbus, Ophir and\n    Tarsis were considered separate entities. Tarsis was generally associated with\n    the ancient city of Tarsus in Asia Minor or with the Spanish port of\n    Tartessus, near Cadiz; alternative theories sought for the biblical port in\n    Sardinia, Britain, and Africa, but the idea of an Eastern&#8211;and by\n    extension American&#8211;placement arose only after the first voyage in 1492.\n    In the <i>Libro de las profecias</i>, edited in collaboration with his son\n    Ferdinando and Fray Gaspar the Gorricio in 1501- 1503, Columbus develops the\n    assimilation between the two lands, asserting that Tarsis is an island, just\n    like Ophir and Cethim. This last toponym is found again in association with\n    Ophir and Tarsis in a letter to pope Alexander VI from 1502 in which we read:\n    "This island is Tarsis, Cethim, Ophir, Ophaz and Cipangu, and we named it\n    Hispaniola." An undatable note in his personal copy of Pliny"s\n    <i>Naturalis Historia</i> equates the two biblical cities to Hispaniola,\n    Feyti, and Cipangu.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Ideas about climate played a consistent role in these discussions. Tropical\n    temperatures are associated with gold, becoming a common denominator linking\n    India, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Caribbean.<a\n        href="#_edn10"\n        name="_ednref10"\n        title=""\n>[10]</a\n>\n    On November 14 1492, passing by the shores of Cuba, Columbus noted in his\n    journal: "According to the great heat that I am suffering, this country must\n    be rich in gold."<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a> In the\n    <i>Lettera rarissima</i>, Columbus writes:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    Josephus thinks that this gold was found in the Aurea; if it were so, I\n    contend that these mines of the Aurea are identical to those of Veragua, which\n    as I have said before, extends westward twenty days\' journey, and they are at\n    an equal distance from the Pole and the Line.<a\n        href="#_edn12"\n        name="_ednref12"\n        title=""\n>[12]</a\n>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    Beyond identifying the mines of Ophir with those of Veragua, Columbus also\n    places them at the same latitude, affirming that "they are at an equal\n    distance from the Pole and the Line." A combination of ideas about distance,\n    heat, latitude and biblical exegesis all came together to produce theories of\n    a New World Ophir. In Vopel\'s map, we find mentions of abundant gold cluster\n    in the vicinity of Beragua, a deeply tropical location just north of the\n    equator on the mainland west of Hispaniola. Just east of the name Beragua, an\n    inscription refers to rivers carrying gold, and just to the west another\n    inscription informs us that along this entire coast much gold is to be found.\n    Just off the eastern coast of this isthmus, we read of happy Jamaica, rich in\n    gold and gems, all pointing to golden, if not Ophirian associations with this\n    part of the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Later in the century, Benito Arias Montano, a learned Spanish scholar at the\n    court of Philip II, further articulated the connection between Ophir and the\n    Americas by proposing a theory about the true location of Ophir in his text\n    <i>Phaleg</i>. According to Montano, Ophir (here, a person as well as a place)\n    and his brother Iobab, sons of Ioctan, arrived in the New World to spread the\n    word of JHWH. Iobab colonized Peru, and Ioctan, Brazil. Montano considered a\n    variety of biblical verses regarding the building of Solomon"s Temple,\n    including "and the gold was the gold of Parvaim" (2 Chronicles 3:6). Drawing\n    on his philological expertise, Montano asserted that the suffix "-im", in the\n    words"<i>Parvaim"</i> "<i>Paruaim"</i> ; "<i>aurum Parvaim" </i>represented a\n    Hebrew dual ending. For Montano, this meant that "<i>Parvaim</i>" meant\n    "double land of Peru"; in effect, 2 Chronicles 3:6 should read "And this was\n    the gold of Peru and Peru."<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""\n>[13]</a\n>\n    Montano therefore located the two cities of Ophir on the Pacific coast of\n    North and South America. Montano also believed that the descendants of Noah\n    were listed in the Bible in geographical order, from west to east. Ophir came\n    before his brother Iobab, the last one and the easternmost of Noah\'s progeny.\n    According to the text, Iobab settled on a mountain called Sepher, which\n    Montano identifies in the Andes, east of Peru. Reminiscences of this biblical\n    colonization, in the end, could be found in toponyms such as the ancient city\n    of Yucatan or the Yucatan peninsula, an homage to the name of their father\n    Ioctan.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Many had critiqued Montano"s ideas, including Jos\xe9 de Acosta and Garcilasco de\n    la Vega. However, the Spanish priest and chronicler Gregorio Garc\xeda, continued\n    to develop Montano"s theories in his\n    <i>Origen de los Indios del Nuevo Mundo e Indias Occidentales</i> (Valencia,\n    1607). By scrutinizing both physical and linguistic similarities between the\n    <i>indios</i> and Israelites, as well as the persistence of the ancient name\n    Peru in names such as Paraguay, Paria or Piura, Garcia maintained that not\n    only was the idea of a biblical migration to the new continent correct, but\n    that the Peruvian location for the mythical Ophir was its indisputable\n    consequence. <a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a> When the\n    Spanish navigator Alvaro Menda"a became the first European to land in the\n    Solomon Islands in 1568, he named them as such because he believed them to be\n    the location of Ophir.<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    While piety may have motivated Columbus to search for Ophir, the forces of\n    Spanish imperialism also played a role in Europeans\' desire to find this\n    ancient place. In either case, any claim that the <i>indios</i> inhabiting the\n    Americas were descendants of the Israelites was a double-edged sword. On one\n    hand, they could have been seen as offspring of a chosen people and therefore\n    worthy of salvation; on the other hand, they could have been accused of having\n    renounced the faith and instead preferred the path of vice and barbarism.\n    However applied, theories about the location of Ophir became tools in\n    the hands of European powers. The Habsburgs could use it to sustain their\n    claims on the people, lands and riches of America: if the\n    <i>indios </i>descended from Noah or from one of the ten lost tribes of\n    Israel, they arrived in the New World through the Iberian Peninsula,\n    establishing a relation that went beyond any treatise or papal bull.<a\n        href="#_edn16"\n        name="_ednref16"\n        title=""\n>[16]</a\n>\n    Besides political and expansionistic drives, however, the case of Ophir\n    represents a critical instance of the shaping of a new global vision after the\n    discovery of America. The fusion of different traditions, secular and\n    religious, ancient and modern, and the overlapping of different geographical\n    spheres is an important reminder of the fluidity of the world in the sixteenth\n    century.<br clear="all"/>\n</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<div style="mso-element:endnote" id="edn1">\n    <p>\n        <a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[1]</a> Christopher Columbus,\n        "Lettera Rarissima," in\n        <i\n        >The Northmen, Columbus and John Cabot 985-1503: The Voyages of the\n            Northmen; The Voyages of Columbus and John Cabot, </i\n        >ed.

It is therefore not surprising to find either species here.<a\n        href="#_edn1"\n        name="_ednref1"\n        title=""\n>[1]</a\n>\n    As a court painter, van Eyck would likely have had access to a live specimen\n    to serve as a model for the parakeet rather than having to paint from\n    descriptions or borrowing from another artist\'s work. Before this painting,\n    parrots had not often been included in religious imagery.<a\n        href="#_edn2"\n        name="_ednref2"\n        title=""\n>[2]</a\n>\n    To understand the parrot\'s presence in this painting and its increasing\n    popularity after Columbus\'s initial voyages to the lands we now know as the\n    Americas, we need to examine the bird\'s association with Paradise.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The parrot\'s ability to speak gives us some explanation for its association\n    with Eden and account for its presence in van Eyck\'s panel. During the Middle\n    Ages in Europe it was widely believed that Eden was in the East. The parrots\n    exchanged on European markets were primarily Asian birds. In recognizing these\n    two points, the connection between parrots and Paradise becomes apparent. They\n    had been paired with other exotic birds, like their fellow Indian species, the\n    peacock, in past depictions of Paradise. This context makes the individual\n    parakeet\'s inclusion in van Eyck\'s pre-Columbian painting all the more\n    puzzling.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> The painting does\n    not depict a garden or an outdoor scene at all. Instead, the canon kneels in\n    prayer with Saints Donation and George flanking the panel and the Virgin,\n    Child, and parakeet are enthroned as a trio in the center.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The speaking bird was thought to say "<i>Ave</i>" in greeting, just as the\n    archangel Gabriel said to the Virgin Mary in the Annunciation. Dominican\n    Franciscus di Retza wrote of the bird\'s word in connection with Gabriel\'s\n    greeting, linking the parrot with the angel and the Annunciation.<a\n        href="#_edn4"\n        name="_ednref4"\n        title=""\n>[4]</a\n>\n    In addition to voice, the impermeability of the parrot\'s green feathers was\n    associated with Mary\'s virginity. The combination of these elements identify\n    the bird as an "angelic messenger."<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""\n>[5]</a\n>\n    Beyond the association with the Virgin, Carol Purtle explains that because the\n    Christ Child is playing with the bird, the parakeet places the scene in\n    heaven, rather than in an earthly paradise.<a\n        href="#_edn6"\n        name="_ednref6"\n        title=""\n>[6]</a\n>\n    Instead of having it serve as a messenger to the Virgin, van Eyck\n    intentionally placed the parrot in Christ\'s hands, relating it to both the\n    Child and His mother. Mary and Christ were often understood to be the new Adam\n    and Eve, and the bird thought to be from Paradise, positioned between, them\n    may allude to this succession. By making the viewer recall the original\n    residents of Paradise, the parrot\'s presence works with the tapestry hung\n    behind the group. The cloth\'s rose pattern and green background refer to\n    enclosed gardens: Eden, metaphors for Mary\'s virginity, and, in literature of\n    the time, "a mystic setting for transcendent experience."<a\n        href="#_edn7"\n        name="_ednref7"\n        title=""\n>[7]</a\n>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Carol Purtle and John Ward have both argued that the canon is having a vision\n    of his postmortem introduction to Christ in heaven, rather than the grouping\n    of mother, Child, and saints being physically present in the church in which\n    Canon van der Paele prays.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a>\n    This interpretation clarifies the parrot\'s participation in the scene. The\n    panel was commissioned for van der Paele\'s tomb as his health declined,\n    meaning that it was created with a particular awareness of the his mortality.\n    Known for its greeting of "<i>Ave</i>" and its association with Paradise, the\n    parrot turns to him and welcomes him to heaven.<a\n        href="#_edn9"\n        name="_ednref9"\n        title=""\n>[9]</a\n>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Van Eyck\'s composition of the Virgin and Child with a green parakeet was\n    imitated again and again over the course of the next century and a half.<a\n        href="#_edn10"\n        name="_ednref10"\n        title=""\n>[10]</a\n>\n    After Columbus\'s voyages and the arrival of American parrots in Europe\n    however, we begin to see parrots appear in art more often and in more diverse\n    settings. We also see a greater diversity in the species represented. At this\n    later point in time, art begins to trend towards depicting macaws, a group of\n    parrot subspecies native to the Americas. Over the course of the sixteenth\n    century, Europeans became accustomed to these new parrots and began depicting\n    them alongside African and Asian species. By the seventeenth century, parrots\n    of all kinds were relatively common in Europe and appeared with some\n    regularity in still lives as well as narrative scenes.<a\n        href="#_edn11"\n        name="_ednref11"\n        title=""\n>[11]</a\n>\n</p>\n<p>\n    As Europe first began familiarizing itself with the new lands across the\n    Atlantic, many explorers remarked upon the large flocks of parrots. Some took\n    finding a species associated with India as a sign that they were in India, or\n    at least somewhere like it. In October of 1492, Columbus wrote, "other than\n    parrots, I have seen no beast of any kind on this island."<a\n        href="#_edn12"\n        name="_ednref12"\n        title=""\n>[12]</a\n>\n    He refers to parrots several more times in the journals describing first\n    voyage. In 1493, Peter Martyr wrote "the parrots brought from [the Caribbean]\n    and many other things show that these islands taste of the soil of India,\n    either because of their proximity or because of their natural properties,"\n    revealing how for Europeans, parrots connected the Americas to Asia.<a\n        href="#_edn13"\n        name="_ednref13"\n        title=""\n>[13]</a\n>\n    When Pedro Cabral landed in Brazil in 1500, he wrote that this "new\n    land...[is] that of the parrots."<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""\n>[14]</a\n>\n    As Europe familiarized itself with the Americas, parrots came to symbolize the\n    mysterious lands across the Atlantic. Geographically located to the west of\n    Europe, the Americas were often understood to be an extension of the East and\n    from Europeans\' first landings on these shores, the presence of parrots seemed\n    to confirm this idea.\n</p>\n<p>\n    As the \'New World\', a term used to refer to newly discovered lands in Asia as\n    well as America, was charted through maps, parrots became emblematic of\n    certain parts of the world. They often appear on other maps as illustrations\n    within the landmasses of Africa and what a modern viewer would now understand\n    to be South America, thought to be part of Asia.<a\n        href="#_edn15"\n        name="_ednref15"\n        title=""\n>[15]</a\n>\n    Possibly the earliest map depicting parrots in Asia is the Ebstorf Mappamundi\n    from the thirteenth century.<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""\n>[16]</a\n>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img\n            width="100%"\n            src="lipsman-images/lipsman-fig2.jpg"\n            alt="Description: Ebstorf Mappamundi full view"\n    />\n</p>\n<p>\n    Fig. 2: Artist Unknown, <i>Ebstorf Mappamundi</i>, ca. thirteenth century, paint on\n    goatskin.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The map centers on a heavenly Jerusalem and is oriented with East at the top\n    of the map. A depiction of Christ\'s head is in the East, marking the top of\n    the map, and just below it, to the right of the two rivers that flow into\n    Christ, is a parrot.<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    The <i>Cantino Planisphere</i>, printed in 1502, is one of the first maps to depict\n    the new lands visited by Columbus.<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""\n>[18]</a\n>\n    <img\n            width="100%"\n            src="lipsman-images/lipsman-fig3.jpg"\n            alt="Description: Cantino Planisphere full view "\n    />\n</p>\n<p>Fig. 3: <i>Cantino Planisphere</i>, ca. 1502, Biblioteca Estense, Modena, Italy.</p>\n<p>\n    It is also the first to use parrots to mark this land mass.<a\n        href="#_edn19"\n        name="_ednref19"\n        title=""\n>[19]</a\n>\n    These new lands are shown as ambiguously shaped, making it clear that they are\n    not yet fully explored. With no border or coast in the West, Cantino leaves\n    the possibility that the mass we now call South America may continue on into\n    Asia. This idea is confirmed by the map\'s original title,\n    <i\n    >Carta de navigar per le Isole nouam tr[ovate] in le parte de India: dono\n        Alberto Cantino al S. Duca Hercole</i\n    >\n    or\n    <i\n    >Map for navigating the new islands found in part of India: a gift by\n        Alberto Cantino for S. Duke Hercole</i\n    >. Though he is depicting unexplored territory, Cantino follows Columbus\'s\n    example and assimilates it into Europe\'s existing understanding of the world\n    by describing it as part of India. The familiar green parrots of modern-day\n    Senegal and African Grey Parrots of Central Africa are contrasted with the\n    bright red macaws of America.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Vopel indicates Cabral\'s "land of the parrots" twice. First, it appears in its\n    Italian translation, "<i>Papagalli terra" </i>on the landmass we now recognize\n    as South America. The second appearance of parrots is in a fictional land\n    placed in the same location as Antarctica. They are depicted in the eastern\n    half of a land mass labeled as "<i>Antarcticus</i>" and "<i\n>Terra Australis nondum cognita</i\n>," which translates to "southern land not yet known". The birds are\n    represented by an illustration of three parrots accompanied by the phrase "<i\n>Psitacorum Terra</i\n>" &#8211; the Latin translation of Cabral\'s words. This phrase often included\n    when maps depict <i>Terra Australis</i>.<a\n        href="#_edn20"\n        name="_ednref20"\n        title=""\n>[20]</a\n>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Europeans\' efforts to understand new flora and fauna by distributing them\n    geographically on maps was complicated by the absence of a clear taxonomic\n    system. Although of different subspecies and modern taxonomic families,\n    monkeys and parrots could be found in Africa, Asia, and South America.<a\n        href="#_edn21"\n        name="_ednref21"\n        title=""\n>[21]</a\n>\n    The effort to represent traditionally understood distributions even as new\n    species within these orders were encountered may have contributed to the\n    understanding that the Americas were an extension of Asia. This interpretation\n    of the new lands may account for why, after Columbus\'s voyages, parrots appear\n    less in places believed to be Asia in the East and more in places believed to\n    be Asia in the West. The assembling of different species under the order\n    Psitacciformes became representative of the \'New World\' as a whole, the place\n    where East and West meet.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Because the Americas were originally considered by Europeans to be a\n    continuation of Asia around the other side of the world, it was logical to\n    place Eden, in the farthest East: in the Americas. The first known use of a\n    parrot in a Temptation scene is Albrecht D\xfcrer\'s 1504\n    <i>Adam and Eve</i> engraving.<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title=""\n>[22]</a\n>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img\n            width="100%"\n            src="lipsman-images/lipsman-fig4.jpg"\n            alt="Description: Adam and Eve engraving with parrot"\n    />\n</p>\n<p>\n    Fig. 4: Albrect D\xfcrer, <i>The Fall of Man (Adam and Eve), </i>1504. Engraving\n    25.2 x 19.4cm. Museum of Fine Arts Boston, 68.187.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Erwin Panofsky\'s analysis of the bird above Adam suggests that its presence is\n    meant to offset the evil of the serpent behind Eve. This is consistent with\n    pre-Columbian associations between parrots and the purity of virginity. The\n    long tail on D\xfcrer\'s parrot points to it being an American species. D\xfcrer had\n    at three parrots in his household: his wife had a small green one, likely to\n    be an Indian bird, and he received one from M\xe1laga.<a\n        href="#_edn23"\n        name="_ednref23"\n        title=""\n>[23]</a>\n    It is unclear if the third parrot was a second green one or a second from\n    M\xe1laga but it is reasonable to guess that it came as one in a pair. We do not\n    know what species D\xfcrer\'s parrot was, but coming from a city on the coast of\n    Spain, it is likely that it was a macaw from a Spanish territory in the\n    Americas.\n</p>\n<p>\n    By the 1520s, parrots had become so popular in Spain that explorers no longer\n    felt the need to include them in their listings of American species. When\n    writing about the animals of the \'New World\' in 1526, Gonzalo Fernandez de\n    Oviedo does not mention parrots at all. He glosses over their exclusion by\n    explaining that it is a waste of time and writing space to discuss species\n    that are already readily available in Spain.<a\n        href="#_edn24"\n        name="_ednref24"\n        title=""\n>[24]</a\n>\n    There is archaeological evidence to support this widespread trade in exotic\n    birds. Two parrot bones dated to the seventeenth century were found at\n    Norwich\'s Castle Mall, which was certainly not a hub of cosmopolitan activity\n    at the time.<a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title="">[25]</a> The number of\n    macaw species represented by artists like Peter Paul Rubens and the increasing\n    representations of parrots through the seventeenth century indicate the\n    booming market for exotic birds.<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title=""\n>[26]</a\n>\n</p>\n<p>\n    By examining parrots, we see how Europeans assimilated the new variety of\n    birds into their existing notions of Paradise and the associated iconography.\n    As they explored the region and better understood its geography, parrots came\n    to symbolize the Americas and the expansion of Europe\'s interactivity with the\n    world. Parrots came to gain their own meaning to Europeans, independent of\n    their Amerasian origins. Bruce Boehrer notes how the increasing appearance of\n    parrots in still lives through the seventeenth century demonstrates their\n    change in status. Prior to 1492, they had served as angelic messengers to men.\n    In the sixteenth century, they were emblems of Amerasia. By the seventeenth\n    century, they had been demoted to locally available commodities.\n</p>\n\n<div id="edn1">\n    <p>\n        <a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[1]</a> Christian Heck and Remy\n        Cordonnier, <i>The Grand Medieval Bestiary</i> (New York: Abbeville Press\n        Publishers, 2012) 502.\n    </p>\n</div>\n\n<div id="edn2">\n    <p>\n        <a href="#_ednref2" name="_edn2" title="">[2]</a> Irma B.

One set, indeed\n        depicted over modern-day Senegal, are entirely green. Without the yellow\n        sides and gray heads, they look less like Senegal Parrots and more like\n        Ring-Necked Parakeets, also native to this part of Africa. The second set of\n        parrots are shown over modern-day Nigera and Cameroon. These birds must be\n        African Gray Parrots as they are native to this region and are accurately\n        depicted by Cantino.

Claudius\n  Ptolemy had supplied some of these, and others were supplied by his\n  commentator Johannes Werner. Indeed, I took note that Claudius Ptolemy had\n  taught that the ratio of the whole latitude to the whole longitude must be\n  maintained not only in the parallel which should be drawn through Rhodes or\n  Thule, but clearly in all of them. Knowing this ratio, a great deal of related\n  things that had previously been obscure became clear to me, and this\n  specification was among them. Once I had produced copious examples for\n  friends, they urged me,&nbsp;almost daily, to publish them and to promise that\n  I would not hesitate to gratify their wishes, should more certain information\n  about the westerly lands reach me. As the unconquerable Charles the Fifth,\n  Emperor of Rome, forever Augustus, was returning to Cologne, I was wisely\n  striking up a friendship with the Castilians well-known for their substantial\n  expertise, who among others were reporting that Baccalaria, Florida, New\n  Spain, and America have boundaries joined with the eastern edges in this\n  hemisphere. Moreover, none of these [Castilians] were able to speak soundly\n  about the matter except for the Emperor, to whom day in and day out they sent\n  back stories from New Spain, speaking in this way about newly discovered\n  scattered islands.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  But then, since it came into consideration (for I had also decided to discuss\n  this matter with his Imperial Majesty ), as I was convening with his Imperial\n  Majesty when investigating these facts, mention was made about these lands\n  recently discussed, and in the midst of this his Imperial Majesty responded\n  that those aforementioned countries were in no way separated by the interval\n  of a sea, but rather connected to the eastern countries. He continued, saying\n  that earlier the Spaniards had again and again gone west exploring from\n  Tenochtitlan, the famous city of the Great Khan, also called Montezuma, and\n  had not been able to find for him an end to the huge land. This would be\n  sufficient proof that the western country reaches to the Chinese region and to\n  the people of China, and make it certain that they belong in the sphere of the\n  Castilians. This information he had received from Indians who had fought in\n  wars with the unconquerable Ferdinand Cortes in New Spain.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I would have quoted more of this statement here, but not for the fact that the\n  book on Cosmography will have a passage about such things when it is\n  eventually brought out, everything, therefore dear reader, that was\n  communicated to me by his Imperial Majesty, and I wish for it to be\n  communicated to you as it was spoken thus.\xa0I offer this upon my arms, and in\n  the meantime it will be of use to you, as you receive it from the mind that\n  was my own source. Furthermore, if you do not delight in these first\n  iterations, then I will publish another drawing depicting a cordiform map.\n  <a name="_anchor_1" href="#_msocom_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>\n</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>\n  <a href="#_moscom_1" name="_anchor_1" title=""> [1] </a>Cordis humani efigiem:\n  a likeness of a human heart.\n</p>\n'},function(e,n){e.exports="<h1>Cartouche on Magellan: Transcription and Translation</h1>\n<h2>Michael Agnew and Gabrielle Roehr</h2>\n<p>\n  Non temere me facturum existimo: si clari uiri aeterna memoria celebrandi\n  Fer/di <i>nandi </i> Magelani [<i>sic</i>] cursum paucis indicarem.

For many years this man, the commander of the ships of Portugal, had\n  traversed the shores of the entire East, and, having crossed the limits of\n  Portuguese territories, he had made trade with the peoples of China, who\u2014he\n  was demonstrating and reporting\u2014belonged to the territory of the Castilians.\n  On account of these injustices inflicted upon him by the king of Portugal, he\n  retreated into Castile. By far the most certain conclusion to be inferred is\n  that it is to be believed that the Moluccas, filled with types of every spice,\n  are contained within the limits of the Castilians. The Unconquerable Caesar\n  provided a fleet of five ships, and Magellan was placed in command as the\n  leader of these. Then, Magellan set sail with the five ships from Seville on\n  August 10, 1519, and within a few days arrived at the Fortunate Isles \u201c[the\n  Canaries, see on map \u201cFORTUNATae insulae,\u201d just north of the Tropic of Cancer\n  off the western coast of Africa]. From there, to the Hesperides [Cape Verde,\n  see on map \u201cHesperidum insulae,\u201d between the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator\n  off the western coast of Africa], from which they began their journey to\n  America, [where] they discovered a promontory, the name for which is Santa\n  Maria \u201c[see on map \u201cC. S. Mariae promontorio dive virginis,\u201d south of the\n  Tropic of Capricorn on the eastern coast of America]. From there, at the end\n  of March of the following year, they were carried down to the port of Saint\n  Julian [on map \u201cP. Iuliani\u201d], where they were suffering an especially bitter\n  winter in May; and indeed, now in our summer, there one must suffer winter.\n  From there, setting sail again on August 24, they arrived at the Province of\n  the Cross on November 26 [see map, \u201cC. Crucis\u201d]. When that place had been\n  abandoned and the narrow sea crossed, they came to the Unfortunate Isles \u201c[see\n  on map, \u201cInsule infortunatae,\u201d just north of the Tropic of Capricorn to the\n  West of America]. Then, after four months, they came to Inuagana [on map, near\n  the figure of Magellan, \u201cInuagana\u201d], and from there to the Moluccas \u201c[see\n  \u201cMoluccae insulae\u201d just north of the Equator at the map\u2019s extreme left edge],\n  where they loaded the ships with cloves. Then, when the Spaniards had set sail\n  from Tidore \u201c[see \u201cMare Theodore\u201d just north of the Equator at the map\u2019s\n  extreme left edge] through the deep Indian Ocean, giving their sails to the\n  wind once they had navigated past the Cape of Good Hope, they arrived again in\n  Spain on September 6, 1522, at the nearby port of Seville.\n</p>\n"},function(e,n){e.exports="<h1>Cartouche on America/Vespucci: Transcription and Translation</h1>\n<h2>Michael Agnew and Gabrielle Roehr</h2>\n<p>\n    America quam Americus Vesputius Nouum orbem Continentem quam/ terram\n    nuncupauit, ab Americo Vesputio eiusdem inuentore nomen for-/tita Castellani\n    uero modo Terram firmam uocant, &amp; ob id non immeri-/to nunc Quarta pars\n    terr\u0119 dicta is ultra \u0119quatorem, ubi conspicatus gen-/tem mores, humanitatem,\n    soli feracitatem, aeris temperiem, salubrita-/temque coeli; nactum se esse\n    testatur cultiores regiones, easdemque habi-/tatoribus frequentiores, quam\n    alibi gentium usquam, si Asiam, si Euro-/pam, Africamque spectaueris\n    &amp;c<i>etera</i>.

The\n    lifestyle of the people of the New World, first encountered by Europeans on\n    the cusp of the sixteenth century, was a lightning rod for the European\n    imagination. Seen as simultaneously idyllic and irrational, hedonistic and\n    na\xefve, the intellectual and creative minds of the period grappled with the\n    geographical, philosophical, social, and spiritual character of these people,\n    through both word and image. Conceived some forty years before Vopel voiced\n    his own such fascination on the cartographic plane, Sir Thomas More\'s\n    apocryphal <i>Utopia </i>blended fact and fiction, satire and sermon, to\n    create a New World account that coyly straddles the boundaries between\n    plausible travel testimony, absurd moral fantasy, and political treatise.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The story, written as an audience between More, fellow real-life humanist\n    Peter Giles and fictional character Raphael Hythlodaeus Organized into a\n    two-book structure, Hythlodaeus first expounds on a critique of the inequity\n    of European&#8211;predominantly English&#8211;society, and then offers a\n    description of the island commonwealth of Utopia as a moralizing\n    counterexample. According to his account, after staying behind with a\n    contingent from Amerigo Vespucci\'s fourth voyage in the New World and\n    traveling westward through diversely peopled lands, Hythlodaeus came upon\n    Utopia, an island society with a sophisticated political, economic, and social\n    system based around communitarian principles: property in common, a disdain\n    for gold and precious stones, religious tolerance, pacifism; equal\n    distribution of labor, and a strict penal system. First published in 1516,\n    <i>Utopia\'</i>s New World setting has been the subject of scrutiny as\n    centuries of Morean scholars have attempted to untangle its course among the\n    many philosophical threads woven into this improbable tale.\n</p>\n<p>\n    While the references, both direct and indirect, to the details of Vespucci\'s\n    letters (see <a href="#weitzman-armeria">Weitzman essay on Buti frescoes and Vespucci</a>) are clear in the\n    text, there has nonetheless been much debate about the extent to which\n    accounts of transatlantic exploration shaped the overall content and motifs of\n    <i>Utopia. </i>One argument is that More\'s vision of a peaceful, orderly\n    commonwealth is far too estranged from Vespucci\'s description of naked,\n    uncouth, and sometimes violent New World natives, and so this inspiration must\n    have been incidental at best.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> Many\n    scholars note that a clear emphasis on Greek culture and philosophy points to\n    ancient authors such as Plato, Homer, and Lucian as More\'s primary influences,\n    rather than any contemporary writing.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a>\n    More certainly strove to promote ancient philosophy as a guiding principle for\n    scholarly thought and rhetoric, and his circle particularly privileged Greek\n    writing and philosophy over Roman.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a> As\n    a noted Greek and Latin scholar, More was better known for his translation of\n    Lucian than the text of <i>Utopia.</i\n><a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a> However, these superficial\n    incompatibilities with the worldly concerns of explorers\' accounts do not\n    preclude the importance of the New World as both a physical and conceptual\n    setting for the Utopians. Rather, More\'s text often dramatizes the ways in\n    which accounts from the New World were fitted into existing paradigms of\n    geography and world history derived from antique models.\n    <i>Utopia </i>repeatedly reveals and develops these paradigms to exploit the\n    shifting terrain of new geographical discoveries.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Initially published in Leuven in Latin, several editions of <i>Utopia</i> were\n    printed in More\'s lifetime accompanied by a group of appendices that\n    reinforced the false authenticity of Hythlodaeus\'s story. The text is\n    introduced as a true account related in person to More in the company of Peter\n    Giles. Their mutual friend Erasmus of Rotterdam helped gather letters from\n    accomplished scholars from their circle to preface the book along with a\n    <a\n            href="https://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/.a/6a00d8341c464853ef01b7c863db20970b-popup"\n    >map of the island </a\n    >(the original designer of which is unknown) and a poem by the supposed poet\n    laureate of Utopia with a Utopian-to-Latin translation. In the second edition\n    of 1518, this map was\n    <a href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:11177599"\n    >updated by Ambrosius Holbein</a\n    >, who also provided an\n    <a\n            href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1441851&amp;partId=1&amp;people=82427&amp;peoA=82427-1-2&amp;page=1"\n            target="_blank"\n    >illustration of Hythlodaeus</a\n    >\n    in audience with More and Giles. The various letters that accompanied the\n    text&#8211; from Giles to Hieronymus van Busleyden, from More to Giles; from\n    Erasmus to printer Johann Froben, and later from Parisian scholar Gillaume\n    Bud\xe9 to Thomas Lupset in the 1518 edition&#8211; all refer to the content of\n    the book as though it were fact, adding to the illusion of truth. The most\n    compelling component of the ruse, however, is the text\'s references to the\n    widely published letters of Amerigo Vespucci.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <i>Utopia</i> was written approximately eleven years after Vespucci\'s letter\n    to Piero Soderini describing his four journeys was first published in Florence\n    circa 1505-1506 under the title\n    <i\n    >Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci delle isole nuovamente trovate in quatro suoi\n        viaggi</i\n    >. The following year, Martin Waldseem\xfcller published his historic\n    <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/2003626426/" target="_blank"\n    >Universalis Cosmographia</a\n    >\n    map depicting an insular western Atlantic landmass titled "America" for the\n    first time, in honor of Vespucci. A Latin translation of the\n    <i>Lettera</i> was included in the map\'s accompanying treatise, the\n    <i>Cosmographiae Introductio</i>, and several historians have made compelling\n    arguments that it is this version of Vespucci\'s letter that More accessed.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a>\n    The letter\'s denouement of the fourth\n    voyage serves as the point of departure for Hythlodaeus\'s account, creating a\n    deliberate air of factual continuity. As Vespucci reaches the conclusion of\n    his letter to Piero Soderini, he states:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    Having done all this, we decided to return to Portugal, which was on a course\n    northeast by north; we left behind twenty-four men to remain in the fort,\n    supplies for six months, twelve mortars and many other weapons; and we\n    pacified all the people of that land, of whom no mention has been made for\n    this voyage, but not because we did not see and have dealings with countless\n    people there: for thirty of our men went forty leagues inland, where I myself\n    saw so many things I must delay relating, saving them for my\n    <i>Four Journeys.</i><a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    This intriguingly open-ended description provided an aperture for More to\n    insert his character\'s account into a record that was still under scrutiny.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a>\n    In the opening pages of\n    <i>Utopia</i>, Giles introduces Hythlodaeus to More, making direct reference\n    to both Vespucci\'s exact words:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    He went everywhere with [Amerigo Vespucci] throughout the last three of his\n    four voyages&mdash; the ones that everyone is now reading about. Except, on the last\n    voyage, he did not come home with him. He begged and even threatened Amerigo\n    until he agreed to let hims stay behind as one of the twenty-four who were to\n    be left garrisoning a fort at the furthest point to which their journey had\n    taken them.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    Other continuities with Vespucci\'s letters became interpretive in their\n    descriptions of the peoples and environs of newly discovered territories. In\n    some attempts to reconcile discrepancy between More\'s highly civilized (by\n    European standards) Utopians and Vespucci\'s descriptions of New World natives\n    that range from the nna\xefve to the monstrous, there is debate that the form of\n    the Utopian commonwealth draws on Vespucci\'s choice of classicizing terms for\n    what he viewed as an essentially primitive society. In particular, amidst\n    stories of cannibalism, lascivious sexual practices, murder, and na\xefvet\xe9 (some\n    of which was illustrated in no uncertain terms in\n    <a\n            href="https://static.cambridge.org/resource/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20170127070941765-0481:9781139568128:03667fig3_3.png"\n            target="_blank"\n    >woodcuts</a\n    >\n    by\n    <a\n            href="https://static.cambridge.org/resource/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20170127070941765-0481:9781139568128:03667fig3_4.png"\n            target="_blank"\n    >Johannes Gr\xfcninger</a\n    >\n    that accompanied the 1509 German edition of the <i>Lettera</i> he nonetheless\n    describes the new territories as a paradise and the people within them as\n    "Epicurean." A particular passage of interest occurs in a fragmentary letter\n    by Vespucci referred to as the "Ridolfi Fragment":\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    ...those inhabitants prize neither gold nor other riches which we value and hold\n    in great esteem, arguing that contrary to this we said we bought slaves from\n    them\xc9. for, as I said their life is rather more Epicurean than Stoic or\n    Academic, because, as I state, they hold no private property, nor have they\n    divisions into kingdoms or provinces: in conclusion, all that they have they\n    hold in common...<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    Later in his letter to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de\'Medici he states again that\n    "They live according to nature, and might be called Epicureans rather than\n    Stoics."<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[10]</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    While this term is far gentler than some of the more barbaric\n    characterizations of indigenous people, it neatly encapsulates a number of\n    Vespucci\'s observations: that these people were pleasure-seeking,\n    non-Christian, and living in a state of prelapsarian na\xefvet\xe9 for which an\n    idyllic antiquity provided a convenient model. Thomas More liberally expands\n    this construct beginning with Utopians\' philosophy of pleasure, their primary\n    ethic of happiness, stating:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    They discuss virtue and pleasure, but their main topic of debate, their\n    primary concern, is the understanding of human happiness ...they hold that its\n    happiness cannot be identified with pleasure, then at least pleasure is the\n    main factor that makes for happiness...<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11"\n>[11]</a\n>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    He further applies an Epicurean model in his description of their legal and\n    penal systems. The harsh consequences for lawbreakers&#8211;slavery, exile or\n    death&#8211; rely on a universal and idealistic ethic of civic obligation\n    where social accountability and self-interest are intertwined.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Vespucci\'s letters may have left an opening for a Classical or Hellenistic\n    imaginary of a New World society, but his explicit references to antiquity are\n    limited. Nevertheless, More adopts and develops this model in a way that\n    transcends analogy, devising a literal Mediterranean origin for the people of\n    Utopia:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    According to their history books, they had no information whatever regarding\n    our part of the world (they call us the Ultra-equatorials) before I made\n    landfall there, with one exception. Twelve-hundred years ago a ship, which had\n    been blown off course by a storm, was wrecked on the island of Utopia. Some\n    Romans and Egyptians were tossed onto the shore and remained on the island for\n    the rest of their lives.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    A significant tool that More uses to forge this heritage is language and\n    wordplay, noting the the Utopians\' ease in developing proficiency in Greek in\n    one passage <a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</a> and later explaining\n    that the Utopians must be descended from the Greeks because their language is\n    etymologically similar. <a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[14]</a> This\n    justifies the many Greek pun names for locations, demonyms, and characters\n    that populate Utopia. Most significant among them is the name for Utopia\n    itself, which elicits two simultaneous translations:\n    Eutopia(&#949;&#965;&#964;&#959;\xb9 &#959;&#962;), meaning "good place", and\n    Ou-topia (&#959;&#965;&#964;&#959;\xb9 &#959;&#962;), meaning "no place". Raphael\n    Hythlodaeus\' name is a humorous compound of hythlo and daeus (&#948;&#945;\n    &#953;&#969;&#957;, &#965;&#952;&#955;&#959;&#962;), meaning peddler or\n    distributor of nonsense. These tongue-in-cheek epithets are found throughout,\n    from the Utopian capital, <i>Amaurot</i> (&#945;&#956;&#945;\n    &#965;&#961;&#959;&#962;, "Unknown" or "Dark" City), to a fictional society\n    Hythlodaeus encountered in his travels through Persia called the Polylerites\n    (\xb9 &#959;&#955;&#965;, &#955;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#962;, "people of much\n    nonsense.")<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[15]</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    These names are couched in a dry humor that hints at the murky authenticity of\n    the account, but they also reflect the geographical ambiguity of the New World\n    in European consciousness. The veracity of accounts from New World journeys\n    did not go undisputed (even Vespucci\'s letters), and the understanding of the\n    New World\'s spatial relationship to both Europe and known Asian territories\n    evolved and was adapted throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in response to\n    changing information. Historian Toby Lester has suggested that More\'s use of\n    wordplay, particularly the double meaning of "Utopia", may have been directly\n    inspired by Waldseem\xfcller\u2019s <i>Cosmographiae Introductio</i>, where writer\n    Matthias Ringmann\'s historic choice to christen the New World "America" may\n    have employed the same logic of the "no-place" as clever subtext to its overt\n    association with Amerigo Vespucci.<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[16]</a> For Vespucci, the eastern edge of\n    what is now called South America represented the confluence of paradise (link\n    to DRACONIS entry), heathendom, and the far more mundane trading pathway to\n    Malacca.<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17">[17]</a> For More, these\n    overlapping identities spoke to a mythological reality.\n</p>\n<p>\n    As part of his sleight-of-hand with the truth, Thomas More leaves the location\n    of the island of Utopia to the imagination of the reader, stating in his\n    preface letter to Peter Giles that he "forgot to ask ...just where in the New\n    World Utopia is to be found."<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18">[18]</a>\n    Keeping its location secret allowed it to reside in a liminal state where the\n    mythical and the real coexist. Nonetheless he localizes Utopia using a\n    <a\n            href="http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/blogs/world-map-after-macrobius"\n            target="_blank"\n    >zonal model</a>\n    of the earth. Unlike Vespucci, who refers to passing through the "torrid"\n    equatorial zone only to refute its supposed hostility<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19">[19]</a>, More refers\n    implicitly to the\n    zonal model and reinforces it through descriptions of the harsh equatorial\n    landscape:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    To be sure, south of the equator, and indeed on either side of it for almost\n    as far as the sun is distant from the earth, there lie vast empty deserts,\n    scorched by the perpetual heat. In every direction the view is gloomy and\n    dismal. Nature is wild and uncultivated. There are savage beasts and dangerous\n    serpents, and a few men who are no less savage and dangerous than the\n    creatures they live among. But if you keep traveling, slowly nature becomes\n    more friendly. The climate is less harsh, the sun less scorching, the\n    creatures les predatory. At length you reach civilization again."<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20">[20]</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    Describing the journey through the torrid zone and beyond, More fills in the\n    gaps between zonal geography and the Greek and New World imaginaries by\n    describing the monsters found in the torrid zone in mythological terms:\n    "Scyllas, or rapacious Celaenos, or man-eating Laestrygonians, or other\n    monsters just as remarkable.<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21">[21]</a> Expressed in recognizable terms,\n    the man-eating giants and sea serpents of Odysseus and the Amazons of Heracles\n    neatly enjoin with reports of Patagonian giants, Amazons, and cannibals that\n    populate literature and cartography charting the exploration of the New World,\n    including the Vopel map.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The Utopians themselves also endorse, albeit obliquely, a zonal construct of\n    the world. Despite having "no information whatever regarding [Europe],"\n    Hythlodaeus reports, "they call us the Ultra-equatorials."<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22">[22]</a> More does not\n    expand on Utopian\n    notions of "Ultra-equatorial" geography, but paints an overall picture of a\n    people with scientific and philosophical competence on par with the antique\n    Mediterranean, particularly in "music, logic, arithmetic, and geometry," but\n    astronomy above all else.<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23">[23]</a> The\n    zonal model being based originally on Pythagorean constructs and having\n    evolved through a series of ancient adaptations concluding in Macrobius,<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24">[24]</a>\n    it is reasonable for the reader to\n    believe that the Utopians have come to parallel conclusions about the\n    antipodes as the Europeans, and the reference to "Ultra-equatorials" posits\n    the equator as the boundary for that reflection. Beyond that frontier, the\n    residents of one side become both mirror and myth to the other, occupying\n    antipodal temperate zones divided by the wasteland.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Guillaume Bud\xe9\'s letter to Thomas Lupset prefacing the 1518 edition of\n    <i>Utopia</i> suggests a specific place that superimposes the mythical on the\n    real:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    [Utopia is] surely one of the Fortunate Isles, which may lie close to the\n    Elysian Fields- Hythloday, as More himself says, has not yet told us exactly\n    where it is located... a community comfortable with its own customs and\n    possessions, blessed with innocence and leading what we might call a heavenly\n    life- Utopia is not in heaven, it is true, but it is certainly far superior to\n    the muck that pervades the known world... Utopia, an island in the New World...<a\n        href="#_edn25"\n        name="_ednref25"\n>[25]</a\n>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    This may be adapted from Vespucci, who no less than three times in his letters\n    refers to the "Fortunate isles" as a key portal through which he passed toward\n    the New World, though in his case he clarifies it as another name for the\n    Canary Islands.<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26">[26]</a> Bud\xe9\'s letter\n    appears to refer, along with Elysium, to the lands of the virtuous dead of\n    Greece, evoking the image of a classical paradise beyond the eastern horizon.\n    Here too, as with Epicureanism, Vespucci\'s casual antique analogy becomes a\n    defining model for the New World of Utopia.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Bud\xe9\'s mythological localization coincides with or perhaps prefigures the\n    thinking of several key writers on the New World, specifically Bartolom\u017d de\n    las Casas whose <i>Historia de Las Indias</i> (1527) hypothesizes that Plato\'s\n    Atlantis was not a fable but a reality proven by the existence of the New\n    World, a massive continent west of the mouth of the Strait of Gibraltar.<a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27">[27]</a>\n    Gonzalo Fern\xe1ndez de Oviedo\n    hypothesizes in his <i>La Historia general de las Indias</i> (1535) that the\n    West Indies were actually the legendary Hesperides, island home of the\n    demigoddess guardians of Atalanta\'s golden apples, which was also associated\n    with the legendary Arcadia.<a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28">[28]</a> The\n    common location of these mythological analogues&#8211; Elysium, Fortunata,\n    Atlantis, the Hesperides&#8211; beyond the western horizon of the\n    Mediterranean creates a plausibility born of geographic consensus and\n    convergence with the New World discoveries. In maps of the 16th century,\n    including the 1520\n    <a\n            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Sch%2525C3%2525B6ner_globe%2523/media/File:Sch%2525C3%2525B6ner_globe_1520_western_hemisphere.jpg"\n            target="_blank"\n    >Johannes Sch\u0161ner Globe</a\n    >, the 1540\n    <a\n            href="https://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/maps/websites/pacific/pacific-ocean/map-pacific-munster-1540.jpg"\n            target="_blank"\n    >Sebastian M\xfcnster map\n    </a>\n    and Caspar Vopel\'s, the Hesperides can be found in varying positions in the\n    Atlantic ocean. Vopel goes a step further in mythologizing the Atlantic by\n    including a less heavenly destination&#8211; <i>Gorgonum insulae</i>, islands\n    of the Gorgons&#8211; just west of Madeira.\n</p>\n<p>\n    This shifting horizon also subtly reorients More\'s vector of the\n    known-to-unknown world from the zonal north/south axis to one wherein\n    continental Europe no longer represents a clear western extreme and the border\n    between a new west and the known, ancient east is undefined. In Vopel\'s map\n    this is expressed through the visual geographic continuity between an American\n    and Asian landmass. In his letters Vespucci states clearly that he has\n    travelled to the "Indian regions"<a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29">[29]</a> in a quest for passage to\n    Taprobane<a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30">[30]</a> or Malacca,<a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31">[31]</a> and\n    despite his overwhelming Greek\n    modeling for <i>Utopia</i>, More did not neglect this crucial motivation; an\n    Asian geographical identity is emphatically present. We know that Utopia must\n    be located within proximity to the Indies, because as More tells us in his\n    initial impressions of Hythlodaeus, that at the end of his sojourn in Utopia,\n    "By remarkable good luck he was on a ship that was driven by a storm to\n    Ceylon, and from there he made his way to Calcutta."<a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32">[32]</a> While this detail\n    suggests\n    proximity to the Indian subcontinent, a further clue&#8211; in Greek of\n    course&#8211; also points to a convergence of the Utopian New World and India.\n    In the\n    <a href="https://www.rct.uk/collection/1086970/utopia" target="_blank"\n    >Utopian cipher facing the frontispiece\n    </a>\n    of text, there is also a poem by the Utopian poet laureate Anemolius, which is\n    transcribed and then translated into Latin at the bottom of the page. The word\n    translated into Latin as "philosopher" is phonetically transcribed from\n    Utopian (supposedly evolved from Greek) as "gymnosophaon," a classical term\n    that commonly referred to philosophers of India.<a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33">[33]</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Lastly, there is a repeated motif of Persian proximity throughout\n    <i>Utopia</i>. It begins with the Persia-adjacent land of the Polylerlites,\n    which Hythlodaeus cites in his Book One, and repeats in the language, history,\n    and culture of Utopia: though Utopian retains "traces of Greek", it "resembles\n    Persian in other respects." In discussing the country\'s founder, Utopus,\n    Hythlodaeus reveals that it was previously called " Abraxa,"<a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34">[34]</a> and he twice\n    names "Mithra" as the\n    common name for god in an otherwise religiously heterogenous society.<a href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35">[35]</a>\n    This explicit Persian proximity is\n    subtly enhanced by the invocation of near eastern gnosticism through Abraxas\n    and the esoteric spiritual traditions of Mithraism but it also proposes a\n    society with a composite culture that blends features of the familiar and\n    foreign. The Utopians occupy a physical space that is just over the horizons,\n    known but not seen, where the newly discovered extremes of east and west\n    converge onto a unified identity.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Inevitably, this multivalent antique/Asian/American imaginary does not\n    comprise a one-way trajectory for which <i>Utopia </i>merely bears witness. In\n    what may be the only contemporary artistic reference to <i>Utopia</i> beyond\n    the illustrations of the first and second editions, a curious print indicates\n    the conflicting characterizations of the New World using <i>Utopia</i> as a\n    pretext. The panoramic scene depicts a bloody battle between clothed and\n    nearly naked men beneath the towering branches of a pine forest. The nude men\n    have neither exoticizing costume beyond their nakedness nor distinctly\n    non-European morphology, and in a\n    <a\n            href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/404505"\n            target="_blank"\n    >first state print of the woodcut\n    </a>\n    in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the only\n    clearly identifying information is the woodcutter\'s mark. In a second state\n    exhibited in Leuven in 2016, however, a poem has been added beneath the image\n    that identifies the nude men as hailing from Utopia, \'not far from Morian\':\n</p>\n<blockquote>Ain Insel hai\xa7t Utopion/ Die leyt nit ferr von Morian</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n    Da g[e] schach ain sollichs schlagen/ Hundert tausent hort ich sagen\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n    Doch ist es eben vil der Jar/ Das ich gelaub es sey nit war\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n    Wann wie wolt ain nackend man/ Ain angelegten pawren b[e] stan...<a href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36">[36]</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    Perhaps the woodcutter is making an early reference to Morpion, a land later\n    cited as existing a quarter league from the Rio de la Plata by Andr\xe9 Thevet\n    in his travel account <i>Les singularitez de la France antarctique</i> (The\n    New Found World, or Antarctike). He states the Spanish encountered wild men\n    nearby<a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37">[37]</a>; could these wild men be\n    the woodcutter\'s Utopians? In any case, his connection to the milieu of\n    <i>Utopia</i> is not arbitrary. Hans L\u0178tzelberger, identified by his monogram,\n    was employed by More\'s Basel publisher Johann Froben , and worked with Hans\n    Holbein the Younger, brother of More\'s 1518 illustrator Ambrosius Holbein in\n    illustrating Reformation bibles and humanist tracts.<a href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38">[38]</a> He may have been\n    intimately\n    familiar with the Utopian narrative and other contemporary travel accounts.\n    The choice to depict More\'s sophisticated, peaceful Utopians as naked, warlike\n    drunkards (a figure at the far left curiously holds a beer tankard) speaks to\n    the text\'s involvement in an ongoing dialogue between reports of the New World\n    and the paradigms projected onto it by the curious intellectual circles of\n    Europe. L\xfctzelberger\u2019s Utopians seem far closer to the people described in\n    Oviedo\'s <i>Historia</i>, who find that the " idolatr\u2019as y errores" of the\n    indigenous Americans echoed the paganism of antiquity in a "religion of the\n    Devil."<a href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39">[39]</a> The woodcutter\'s poem\n    remains ambiguous, perhaps alluding to the questionable veracity of\n    conflicting New World testimonies and their interpretations by skeptically\n    dismissing eyewitnesses to his invented Utopian battle: "Hundert tausent hort\n    ich sagen/ Doch ist es eben vil der Jar/Das ich gelaub es sey nit war" states\n    (in rough translation) that though "a hundred thousand heard [the story] told/\n    it was many years ago/ I don\'t believe it happened."<a href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40">[40]</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Michel Foucault tells us that "Utopias are sites with no real place. They are\n    sites that have a general relation of direct or inverted analogy with the real\n    space of Society. They present society itself in a perfected form, or else\n    society turned upside down, but in any case these utopias are fundamentally\n    unreal spaces." <a href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41">[41]</a> This may be a\n    serious mischaracterization of Thomas More\'s <i>Utopia</i>. Its legacy has\n    outgrown its original context to become the namesake of a vast\n    cross-disciplinary genre of visionary worlds that quite often exist outside of\n    physical space as Foucault suggests: projections of desire that passively\n    represent an impossible ideal. But <i>Utopia </i>problematizes place and space\n    in an inherently different way. More\'s utopia is full of improbable ideals and\n    radical notions like any other, some that are shockingly revolutionary even to\n    a twentyfirst century reader. But the space it occupies, though unresolved, is real:\n    the New World.\n</p>\n<p>\n    This New World is not truly new; it is merely the unseen reaches of the Old\n    World that have long existed over the horizon, now beginning to come into\n    view. While his primary intention may be to promote the virtues of a society\n    modeled on Greek philosophy rather than to discern the identity of new lands\n    or attempt an anthropological portrait, the setting is key to rendering its\n    improbability believable, appropriating the New World\'s inherent geographical,\n    topological, and cultural mutability, already rich in contradiction and\n    fantastical detail. He utilizes this manifold imaginary to disguise the\n    fictitiousness of Hythlodaeus\'s account. The physical distance of America and\n    the temporal distance of antiquity become analogous to one another, just as\n    the north/south axis of the known-to-unknown becomes interchangeable with the\n    axis of east to west and the Elysian fields converge with India; Hythlodaeus\n    himself becomes an analogue for Ulysses and Vespucci simultaneously. Rather\n    than occupying a "fundamentally unreal space," Utopia occupies a real space\n    that simply has yet to be defined in fixed terms and so can realistically be\n    all things at once.

Lester argues for Ringmann as the author of the\n        <i>Cosmographiae </i>in large part because of his unique interests and\n        skillset as a Graecophile like More. In exploring the ways in which this\n        manifests, Lester proposes a similar interest in wordplay that exploits the\n        similarity between Vespucci\'s given name, Amerigo, and an array of Greek\n        neologisms directly analogous to "Utopia." On pages 356-358 he states "The\n        name may also contain a play on meros, a Greek word that can sometimes be\n        translated as "place". Here Amerigen becomes A-meri-gen, or "No-place-land":\n        not a bad way to describe a previously unnamed continent whose geography is\n        still uncertain," and when commenting on the <i>Cosmographiae\'</i>s\n        influence on More on page 377, he observes, "The name Utopia itself- a word\n        coined by More from Greek roots to mean "no-place" (ou-topia), "good place"\n        (eu-topia), or both- bears an uncanny likeness to the name America. Both are\n        three-syllable coinages derived from Greek, both identify a previously\n        unknown region across the ocean and suggest it may be a kind of Nowhere Land\n        (A-meri-gen, or "no-place-land," and ou-topia or "no-place"), and both\n        involve a private play on words intended for a small audience of highly\n        educated humanists."\n    </p>\n</div>\n<div id="edn17">\n    <p>\n        <a href="#_ednref17" name="_edn17">[17]</a>Amerigo Vespucci, "Letter VI to\n        Piero Soderini (Quattro Viaggio)" in\n        <i>Letters from a New World: Amerigo Vespucci\'s Discovery of America</i>,\n        ed.

Francesco\u2019s brother, Ferdinando I, who succeeded him as Duke of\n    Tuscany, rushed to decorate the armory before his wedding to Christina of\n    Lorraine. The room contained weapons and armor from around the world,\n    including the New World and India, acquired by Francesco, an avid collector.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn1"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref1"\n        title=""\n>[1]</a\n>\n    In 1588, Medici court artist Ludovico Buti completed frescoes on the armory\u2019s\n    ceiling depicting four international battle scenes to accompany the weapons on\n    display, now gallery room 20 in the Uffizi in Florence (Figure 1, 2).\n    The grotesque tracery design was common during this period, particularly for\n    armory ceilings, but in this case bolsters the fantastic forms of New World\n    discoveries.<a href="#_weitzman_edn2" name="_weitzman_ednref2" title=""\n>[2]</a\n>\n    Although exceedingly wealthy, the Medici did not have the financial\n    wherewithal to fund their own New World expeditions. Because the room\n    displayed the Medici arms collection and was considered a social space, it is\n    likely that Ferdinando, as the new Duke, intended to utilize the room to\n    project his family\u2019s wealth and power to the wedding guests and other\n    dignitaries. Ludovico Buti served these needs by presenting an amalgamation of\n    New World cultures and conquests by utilizing prints, maps, and texts\n    circulating within the Medici cultural milieu. While current scholarship has\n    demonstrated that there are clear political agendas addressed in the armory\u2019s\n    imagery which align the family with Spain and Portugal, I argue that Buti\u2019s\n    intermix of disparate cultures also reveals the Medici considered New World\n    objects to be only loosely separate from the Asian continent during the late\n    Cinquecento. By interlacing the New World with India, the armory\u2019s imagery\n    reveals a court culture in which the definition of the Americas was still in\n    flux. As such, the fresco reflects Francesco\u2019s desire to have agency in New\n    World discoveries, while simultaneously revealing a broader resistance to\n    modifying the continent\u2019s Ptolemaic, and thus anachronistic, connection to\n    Asia.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The armory\u2019s four battle scenes fan out from the center of the ceiling and\n    depict conflicts between Western European armies and natives from America,\n    Africa, and Asia. The scenes to the ceiling\u2019s north and south feature imagery\n    with clear cultural signifiers and some indication of geography, although it\n    is not totally conclusive, whereas the east and west scenes are less\n    straightforward. The battle located to the north (Figure 3) depicts the\n    Medici, as signified by the <i>palle</i> banner paraded on horseback,\n    defeating the Turks in striped turbans who clamor up the side of a hill after\n    dropping their crescent moon flag. The background is less clear as a\n    nondescript maritime setting, which could depict the battle of Piombino, a\n    crucial trade port developed by Ferdinando.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn3"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref3"\n        title=""\n>[3]</a\n>\n    Directly below the scene is a marginal rectangular gold box with tracery\n    design containing two elephants and spiky palms. The opposite battle on the\n    southern side of the ceiling (Figure 4) could be a clash between the\n    Spanish, as signified by the red and white standard,<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn4"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref4"\n        title=""\n>[4]</a\n>\n    and New World feathered natives, who defend themselves with spears and shields\n    against the far superior European guns.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn5"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref5"\n        title=""\n>[5]</a\n>\n    The background is dotted with tropical foliage and arched huts cascading along\n    rolling hills, and another small rectangular box is positioned below the scene\n    containing a native standing contrapposto with a rhinoceros.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The scenes on the east and west ends of the ceiling are less detailed and more\n    difficult to identify. Lia Markey argues the skin color, dress, and weaponry\n    of the natives are evidence that the two scenes are battles between Turks and\n    Africans (Figure 5), and Islamic North Africa and the Portuguese (Figure 6).<a href="#_weitzman_edn6"\n                                                                                   name="_weitzman_ednref6" title=""\n>[6]</a\n>\n    The Turks in the lower left corner of the African scene are identifiable based\n    on their striped clothing and turbans. However, the identity of their\n    opponents is not decidedly African. Given the figures are wearing loin cloths\n    and carrying bows and swords, and the setting is mountainous and hilly, with\n    tropical foliage containing low huts featured in Buti\u2019s American battle\n    between the Spanish, the sense of place is muddied and could also be\n    identified as a New World setting. The battle between Islamic North Africa and\n    the Portuguese is similarly convoluted.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The central <i>tondo </i>(Figure 7) unites the four battle scenes and\n    acts as a sharp foil to their frenetic energy and violence. It is idyllic,\n    with tropical foliage and a hint of architecture in the background, devoid of\n    both war and European figures. In the foreground, seven men wearing striped\n    loin cloths and full feathered headdresses, carrying arrows and a parasol,\n    parade a cloaked regal figure across the edge of the frame. The \u201cchief\u201d\n    carries what appears to be a type of battle axe, which was likely similar to\n    one on view in the armory. The parade of natives is a spectacle of mannered\n    and classicizing poses, weapons, and display of exotica, which Peter Mason\n    considers a hybrid assemblage of motifs that has moved away from ethnographic\n    accuracy.<a href="#_weitzman_edn7" name="_weitzman_ednref7" title=""\n>[7]</a\n>\n    The headdressed natives set in an architectural tropical landscape are\n    congruent with the inexact exotica in rest of the scenes. Who, and where, are\n    these natives?\n</p>\n<p>\n    The ambiguous geographic locations and fluidity of iconographic signifiers in\n    all four battle scenes bring to bear the scholarly problem of discerning how\n    the Medici defined America and its natives, landmasses, and objects. The\n    conflated idea of \u201cAmerasia,\u201d a term that refers to the amalgamation of\n    America and Asia in sixteenth-century maps, imagery, and texts, is a problem\n    circulating through current scholarly arguments with no resolution. In the\n    case of Buti\u2019s armory fresco, Amerasian imagery is present in the battle\n    between the Medici and American natives, particularly in the rhinoceros below,\n    and the central <i>tondo</i> in which architectural details, flora, and native\n    dress blur demarcation between New World Americas and broadly southern Asian\n    signifiers such as bananas,<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn8"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref8"\n        title=""\n>[8]</a\n>\n    a parasol, and the chief\u2019s bier (a trope that will be examined later through\n    circulating prints). In her seminal 2015 book\n    <i>Imagining the Americas in Medici Florence</i>, Lia Markey argues that by\n    using cultural generalizations to contextualize Medici weaponry, Buti\u2019s\n    ceiling is a theatrical performance of foreign natives whose ethnographic\n    rendering was intended to demonstrate the weapons in use while also\n    politically aligning the Medici with New World discoveries.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn9"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref9"\n        title=""\n>[9]</a\n>\n    Ultimately, Markey argues that Ferdinando was responding to Philip II, King of\n    Spain, Portugal, and Sicily, who banned Amerasian imagery because of its\n    blasphemous content. Ferdinando was careful not to undermine Philip\u2019s desires\n    because the Medici depended on Spain\u2019s financial partnership.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn10"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref10"\n        title=""\n>[10]</a\n>\n</p>\n<p>\n    However, with the problem of Amerasia in mind, additional connotations emerge\n    from the frescoes\u2019 details when considering contemporary costume books, texts,\n    and maps that would have been familiar to the Medici court. Although the\n    Medici likely viewed these lands as separate continents and conquests, they\n    might also have conceptualized America and Asia as a region of the world where\n    the East met the West. Thus, by utilizing ubiquitous reference materials\n    present within the Medici milieu, the contemporary viewer might have\n    understood the multifarious signifiers in Buti\u2019s imagery as depicting a New\n    World in close concert with India and Southeast Asia, as well as the Medici\n    alignment to these conquests through collections and political alliances\n    displayed prominently in the armory. There is little scholarship outside of\n    Markey\u2019s work that considers the social implications of Buti\u2019s fresco. In\n    addition to its theatricality and political implications, Buti\u2019s iconography\n    has an ideological demarcation that is worth investigating.\n</p>\n<p>\n    At the intersection of Asian and New World iconography are ethnographic\n    composites of disparate New World cultures. The mixing of New World societies\n    through objects and depictions of its natives, particularly Aztec and\n    Brazilian in this case, should be examined at the outset, because the larger\n    issue of cultural overlap between Asia and New World imagery is partly rooted\n    in an unclear definition of the word \u201cIndian.\u201d<b> </b>In 1588, when Ferdinando\n    assumed responsibility for completing the armory decoration, the definition of\n    terms such as \u201cNew World\u201d and \u201cIndian\u201d were still decidedly fluid; \u201cNew World\u201d\n    could refer to newly discovered lands of both the east and west. (On the range\n    of meanings of the word India and Indians,\n    <a href="#riccio-india">see the entry by Vittoria Riccio</a>.) Ferdinando\u2019s\n    collection inventories from c.1571 to 1588 use the terms <i>Indiana</i>,\n    <i>alla Indiana</i>, and <i>dell</i><i>\u2019</i><i>Indie </i>to define objects\n    from the Americas, India, of Moorish origin, and Asia more generally.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn11"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref11"\n        title=""\n>[11]</a\n>\n    The word \u201cIndian\u201d itself is loaded and imprecise. Jessica Keating and Lia\n    Markey\u2019s research reveals that the term has often been taken for granted in\n    current scholarly research, and could refer to anything that is of abundance,\n    exotic, of a \u201cforeign\u201d style, or simply non-European.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn12"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref12"\n        title=""\n>[12]</a\n>\n    In order to create believable and verisimilar imagery of places and people\n    neither Buti nor Francesco had ever seen firsthand, Buti borrowed from\n    multiple sources that originated from both the broader continent of Europe and\n    the New World, further augmenting the ambiguity of these terms.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Markey has already examined Bernardino de Sahag\xfan\u2019s c.1577\n    <i>Florentine Codex\u2014</i>an important source for Buti\u2019s imagery that belonged\n    to Ferdinando. The <i>Codex</i>, a three-volume illustrated manuscript,\n    documents the lives of the Aztecs during the conquest of New Spain.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn13"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref13"\n        title=""\n>[13]</a\n>\n    It is considered to be one of the most thorough and important documents\n    describing Aztec and Mexican culture and the flora of the region.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn14"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref14"\n        title=""\n>[14]</a\n>\n    (On the Florentine Codex owned by Ferdinando I de Medici,\n    <a href="#raitt-florentinecodex">see the entry by Louisa Raitt</a>.) Markey\n    also demonstrates that Buti\u2019s quotations range from codices to circulating\n    Flemish, French, and German prints, further demonstrating his appropriation of\n    a variety of sources for the armory ceiling imagery.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn15"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref15"\n        title=""\n>[15]</a\n>\n    Another possible influence on Buti\u2019s imagery worth considering is the two\n    Amerasian figures in Christopher Weiditz\u2019s c.1530s <i>Trachtenbuch </i>(Figure 8), an illustrated costume book that\n    in itself carries further significance\n    because of its commixture of native cultures. Although the\n    <i>Trachtenbuch</i> was not widely circulated, Weiditz\u2019s illustrations were\n    disseminated separately as copies.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn16"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref16"\n        title=""\n>[16]</a\n>\n    The manuscript showcases contemporary dress belonging to varied social ranks\n    including indigenous Aztecs. The natives\u2019 loincloths and the blue and red\n    bulky striped cape draped over the king in Buti\u2019s center <i>tondo</i> are as\n    close to Weiditz\u2019s imagery as other scholarly comparisons to the<i> Codex</i>.\n    Elizabeth Boone argues Weiditz\u2019s images are more sartorial than accurate, as\n    many of his drawings are glossed as Aztecs but dressed in Brazilian feathered\n    skirts and headdresses\u2014again, exoticizing the figures by converging\n    ethnographic elements from a variety of sources.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn17"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref17"\n        title=""\n>[17]</a\n>\n    Buti\u2019s own combination of the <i>Codex </i>and <i>Trachtenbuch </i>is thus a\n    response to the larger pedagogical environment within the court driven by\n    costume books and circulating prints.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn18"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref18"\n        title=""\n>[18]</a\n>\n</p>\n<p>\n    The influence of itinerant print materials on Ludovico Buti\u2019s imagery also\n    extended to widely circulated continental allegories. Coupled with the\n    fluidity of regional definitions applied to Medici inventory, Giovanni\n    Stradano\u2019s c.1580s \u201cVespucci\u2019s Voyage of Discovery\u201d print from the\n    <i>Americae Retectio </i>(Figure 9), drawing from the legacy of Amerigo\n    Vespucci and his ties to the Medici, provides additional information regarding\n    how the Medici sought to project themselves and their view of the New World.\n    Created in the Medici court during the time Ferdinando transitioned to Duke,\n    Stradano celebrates Vespucci, who stands tall on his ship with his family coat\n    of arms blowing in the wind, with the Spanish standard below. The city of\n    Florence is represented by Mars riding a turtle pulled by lions, and Minerva\n    to the lower right, with lilies symbolizing the Virgin of Florence.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn19"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref19"\n        title=""\n>[19]</a\n>\n    To the left of the broken mast is a fantastical figure in full feather\n    headdress carrying a club and skewered human arm\u2014an image in close concert\n    with the headdresses of Buti\u2019s natives, and one of few prints during the late\n    Cinquecento that features large peacock-like plumes. Markey argues that\n    Stradano was responding to imagery and accounts of New World native\n    cannibalism and presents this native as a proud but demonic fantasy.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn20"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref20"\n        title=""\n>[20]</a\n>\n    Vespucci was a crucial figure for the Medici as secretary on a diplomatic\n    mission to France, and later Spain. He represented Florence in New World\n    expeditions, which was important to the Medici\u2019s political prowess as they\n    were not active participants in these voyages. The fixation on Vespucci and\n    his alignment with the discovery of the New World is still evident in the\n    creation of images like Stradano\u2019s, and indicates a pervasive ideological\n    attachment to his conquests.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn21"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref21"\n        title=""\n>[21]</a\n>\n</p>\n<p>\n    The full-plumed headdresses on Buti\u2019s natives could be a quotation of\n    Stradano\u2019s allegory given their visual congruence, but, in turn, also a\n    reference to Vespucci\u2019s textual accounts of America. Vespucci embarked on four\n    expeditions along the coasts of modern Brazil and Venezuela which he referred\n    to in earlier letters as the \u201cthe south of Asia,\u201d and in a second letter\n    vaguely described a single land mass that was \u201cnot Asia.\u201d<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn22"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref22"\n        title=""\n>[22]</a\n>\n    In Vespucci\u2019s correspondence to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de\u2019 Medici and\n    Florentine statesman Piero Soderini, he refers repeatedly to the natives they\n    encountered as nude and cannibalistic, white or red in complexion, and some\n    bearing round shields, spears, and bows and arrows.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn23"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref23"\n        title=""\n>[23]</a\n>\n    Buti includes natives with variant complexions who carry spears and shields in\n    the Spanish battle scene, and the plethora of parrots in the tracery also\n    echoes Vespucci\u2019s accounts of the variety of colorful birds he encountered.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn24"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref24"\n        title=""\n>[24]</a\n>\n    (On parrots, <a href="#lipsman-parrots">see the entry by Claire Lipsman</a>)\n    As Vespucci sailed far south along the coast of what is known as South America\n    in search of gold, it is clear from his letters that he became more convinced\n    they had embarked on new land rather than a continuation of the Asian\n    continent.<a href="#_weitzman_edn25" name="_weitzman_ednref25" title=""\n>[25]</a\n>\n    His reports hinted at the possibility that Columbus\u2019s Asiatic landmass was\n    surrounded by two oceans\u2014an inference which later became the first\n    cartographic reference to the Pacific Ocean depicted by\n    <a name="_Hlk532114433">Martin Waldseem\xfcller</a> (Figure 10).<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn26"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref26"\n        title=""\n>[26]</a\n>\n    At the suggestion of Waldseem\xfcller, the region was christened with Amerigo\n    Vespucci\u2019s namesake, which had deep connections to Florence, the Medici, and\n    their court.<a href="#_weitzman_edn27" name="_weitzman_ednref27" title=""\n>[27]</a\n>\n    Coupled with Vespucci\u2019s accounts, Stradano\u2019s imagery and his ties to the court\n    allowed the Medici some authorship in the phenomenon of the New World. In this\n    respect, Stradano\u2019s imagery carries particular resonance in the midst of\n    hundreds of allegorical prints circulating during the period.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Although Waldseem\xfcller\u2019s c.1507 map demonstrates that Vespucci\u2019s descriptions\n    marked the beginning of a shift in the way the Americas were depicted as\n    cartographically separate from Asia, it is not proof that the Medici\u2019s own\n    conceptualization of the Americas changed as quickly. Rather, while Brazilian\n    iconography prevails in Buti\u2019s Amerindian imagery as demonstrated by his\n    quotation of Weiditz, as well as visual connections to Stradano\u2019s courtly work\n    and Vespucci\u2019s Florentine legacy, Asian references in Ludovico Buti\u2019s imagery\n    are equally prevalent and significant. One probable connection to the Asian\n    continent in Ludovico Buti\u2019s armory ceiling is the convincingly rendered\n    rhinoceros below the battle scene between New World natives and Spanish\n    conquistadors (Figure 11). The inclusion of the rhinoceros is not\n    perfunctory. Buti also positions two elephants below the opposite Medici\n    scene; because the Turks often used elephants in battle, the iconography is\n    fitting in this particular context.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn28"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref28"\n        title=""\n>[28]</a\n>\n    With a clear cultural conjunction in the elephants, one can infer that the\n    rhinoceros carries a similar signification.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The rhinoceros also appears in Francesco I de Medici\u2019s sixteenth-century\n    fabricated grotto in the Garden of Castello at the outskirts of Florence (Figure 12). The menagerie of thirty six\n    animals include, among others, native European fauna:\n    an Indian elephant, rhinoceros, and goat, an African lion, giraffe, and camel,\n    and a New World turkey\u2014referred to as <i>gallina d\u2019 India </i>in inventories\n    and the larger courtly milieu in Rome and Florence, and often equated with the\n    peacock (which could explain Stradano\u2019s peacock plumes on his allegory of\n    America).<a href="#_weitzman_edn29" name="_weitzman_ednref29" title=""\n>[29]</a\n>\n    This composite reflects a similar approach to both Buti\u2019s imagery and Medici\n    cataloging of precious objects. This conflation of culture is mirrored by the\n    liberal nature of cataloging by terminology and categorization in Medici\n    inventories c.1539 and 1564, which classified objects by type, such as\n    weapons, costumes, animals, and masks, rather than separating them by\n    geographic region.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn30"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref30"\n        title=""\n>[30]</a\n>\n    Further, according to Claudia Lazzaro, the Indian rhinoceros was rarely seen\n    in person, but Albrecht D\xfcrer\u2019s 1515 print (Figure 13) made wide\n    circulation and was most likely the model for the grotto.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn31"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref31"\n        title=""\n>[31]</a\n>\n    It is possible that the print stood in for Buti\u2019s rendering as well, forming a\n    clear association with India. Thus, the rhinoceros in its clear connection to\n    the grotto, and the elephants and their connection to the Turks, form a\n    central line across the fresco that represents not only conquest but a New\n    World that overlaps with Indian cultural signifiers.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Imagery tied to India featuring New World natives was also present in\n    circulating prints and atlases during Buti\u2019s period. German painter and\n    printmaker Hans Burgkmair\u2019s c.1526 print series\n    <i>People of Calicut: The Triumphal Procession of Emperor Maximilian I </i>(<i\n>figures 14, 15, 16</i\n>) features an interwoven group of disparate figures. The leader wears a\n    turban and rides an elephant, followed by a processional of figures in New\n    World feather headdresses and skirts marching with an array of animals, and\n    carrying another leader on a bier with a parasol.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn32"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref32"\n        title=""\n>[32]</a\n>\n    Buti\u2019s <i>tondo </i>is a similar parade. William Sturtevant notes that the\n    <i>Calicut </i>print\u2019s details were derived from accounts of Balthasar\n    Springer\u2019s c. 1505-1506 travels to India.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn33"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref33"\n        title=""\n>[33]</a\n>\n    Peter Mason argues that Burgkmair\u2019s <i>Calicut </i>prints contain both\n    American and Indian imagery\u2014a detail that both mimics Buti\u2019s cross-cultural\n    depictions in the armory and reveals that one cannot attribute all featherwork\n    to American natives.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn34"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref34"\n        title=""\n>[34]</a\n>\n    In grouping these seemingly disparate figures together in one procession,\n    Burgkmair inextricably links their geographic proximity. Burgkmair\u2019s\n    processional demonstrates a commixing of cultures present in all four of\n    Buti\u2019s battle scenes and central <i>tondo</i>\u2014turbaned Turks, feathered\n    American natives, and an assembly of Asian and Indian animals\u2014while collecting\n    them under the canopy of \u201cCalicut.\u201d Georg Braun and Franz Hogenberg\u2019s c. 1572\n    colored print of the shores of Calicut in the widely circulated atlas of\n    cities <i>Civitates Orbis Terrarum </i>(Figures 17, 18) also shares\n    pictorial congruence with Buti\u2019s <i>tondo </i>scene.\n    <i>Zamorin of Calicut</i> depicts a sprawling coast filled with ships, their\n    course of travel ambiguous, and natives parading on the sand with a parasol\n    and their emperor on a bier\u2014similar to Buti\u2019s parade of Amerindians in their\n    costume, weaponry, and classicized gait, as well as his native with the\n    rhinoceros, who wears a comparable headdress with a tail of hair whipping in\n    the wind. To the far right are two fat elephants roaming inland. That a\n    feathered native and chief on a bier can be considered both from America and\n    Calicut/India, and elephants can be Turkish or Indian demonstrates the looser\n    visual demarcation regarding the New World as a geographic place still\n    prevalent in Buti\u2019s period and fully adopted into Medici visual culture.\n</p>\n<p>\n    That Burgkmair and Braun/Hogenberg\u2019s depictions of Calicutians use similar\n    iconographic tropes presented in Buti\u2019s American natives could indicate\n    confusion, a conflation of \u201cforeign,\u201d \u201cexotic,\u201d \u201cIndian,\u201d or \u201cNew World\u201d\n    things. By borrowing from multiple circulating prints and codices, Buti\n    created adulterated images in the armory that likely seemed familiar to the\n    viewer but lacked specificity. Evidence that the Medici were slower to let go\n    of cultural consolidation and references to the Indies is also present in\n    contemporary maps that were important cultural artifacts. The Guardaroba (Figure 19) was another colossal project\n    spearheaded by the Medici family meant to\n    bring order to their collection of transcontinental objects through organizing\n    objects by region, but was never fully realized. Unlike the typical\n    <i>studiolo </i>that often combined New World objects with unknown provenance\n    into the broad category of \u201cThe Indies,\u201d<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn35"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref35"\n        title=""\n>[35]</a\n>\n    fifty-three maps were painted by Egnazio Danti and Stefano Buonsignori on\n    large cabinet doors that were to house hundreds of objects corresponding to\n    each map\u2019s location. Completed in 1586, the project marked a paradigm shift in\n    mapmaking during the period. The maps were rooted in Ptolemaic tradition but\n    updated to reflect discoveries and fluctuating understanding of landmasses.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn36"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref36"\n        title=""\n>[36]</a\n>\n    The inventory and contents of the Guardaroba cabinets are an unresolved\n    problem, complicating our contemporary understanding of how the Medici viewed\n    the world. However, much like Buti, we know Egnazio Danti sourced multiple\n    prints, manuscripts, nautical charts, and travelers\u2019 reports to accurately\n    portray each region.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn37"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref37"\n        title=""\n>[37]</a\n>\n    For our purposes, the Guardaroba\u2019s significance lies in the fact that it is\n    extant proof the Medici understood Africa, Asia, and America as separate\n    landmasses. But the maps are rooted in, and indeed surpass, the ancient\n    Ptolemaic tradition which was tied to their humanist and erudite culture,<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn38"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref38"\n        title=""\n>[38]</a\n>\n    and was also of crucial importance to Vespucci\u2014evident through Vespucci\u2019s\n    reference to Ptolemaic maps in his early letters.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn39"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref39"\n        title=""\n>[39]</a\n>\n</p>\n<p>\n    We also know that Danti consulted Abraham Ortelius\u2019s c.1570 world map from the\n    <i>Theatrum Orbis Terrarum </i>(Figure 20), which was widely known in\n    the Medici court.<a href="#_weitzman_edn40" name="_weitzman_ednref40" title=""\n>[40]</a\n>\n    It is through Ortelius that we can gain some purchase on one way the Medici\n    might have conceptualized the New World: while originating from separate\n    landmasses, there is an indelible intimacy between Southeast Asia, India, and\n    the Americas. Ortelius\u2019s world map has a clear demarcation of the continents;\n    however, New Guinea is positioned in close proximity to the Americas, which\n    physically situates the New World to the east, rather than the west. If the\n    map were connected at either side to form a globe, the Americas would nearly\n    touch Cathay. (On Cathay, Tangut, and Mangi on sixteenth-century maps,\n    <a href="#wu-tangut-cathay-mangi">see the essay by Peiyue Wu</a>.) Within the\n    <i>Theatrum Orbis Terrarum </i>there is also a detailed map of the Pacific (Figure 21), the first of its kind. The\n    Americas are positioned in close proximity to\n    China, New Guinea, and Japan, leaving a Pacific Ocean that is smaller than how\n    we understand it today, underscoring the probability that the Medici and their\n    contemporaries did not completely divorce the Americas from the East.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Ortelius\u2019s <i>Indiae Orientalis, </i>in the same atlas, (Figure 22)<i\n> </i>reveals similar information to his map of the Pacific. India and\n    Southeast Asia are presented as a landmass without boundaries, in close\n    proximity to Japan, Papua New Guinea, and the Americas. The American continent\n    is labelled in Latin as <i>Americae Siue Indiae</i>\u201cAmerica or India.\u201d\n    The intimacy of the Americas and the East and its textual connection to India\n    mirrors Ludovico Buti\u2019s seemingly appropriative armory ceiling, and in this\n    respect qualifies the logic in commingling Indian signifiers with Brazil and\n    Aztec in sixteenth-century pictorial representations. German cartographer\n    Caspar Vopel\u2019s c.1545 map\n    <i\n    >Nova Et Integra Vniversaliqve Orbis Totivs IVXTA Germanvm Neotericovm\n        Traditionem Descriptio</i\n    >\n    (copied in Venice c.1558) also joins New Spain with Asia. The Harvard c.1558\n    copy by Vavassore is divided into 12 prints that make up a map of the world.\n    In the top left section, <i>India Orientalis </i>is merged with\n    <i>Asia Magna, Messigo, </i>and <i>Hispania. </i>In the neighboring section to\n    the right, <i>Asia Orientalis </i>is just above <i>Hispania Major</i>. Further\n    down the map in what appears to be modern Mexico or South America is\n    <i>America Nova Orbis Pars </i>(Figures 23 - 26).\n</p>\n<p>\n    While Vopel\u2019s map did not originate in Italy, Florence was not divorced from\n    the culture from which it emerged; as demonstrated, prints from Germany,\n    Antwerp, and across Europe played some role in developing the courtly\n    worldview of an America conjoined with, or closely related to, Asia.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn41"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref41"\n        title=""\n>[41]</a\n>\n    With this in mind, it is likely the Medici and their artists understood the\n    New World and its natives to be of the East and aligned more closely\n    ideologically with the expansive India Orient that in the Ptolemaic tradition\n    lies \u201cbeyond the Ganges,\u201d or as Columbus described during his second voyage in\n    1494, Alpha-Omega, where East meets West.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn42"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref42"\n        title=""\n>[42]</a\n>\n    This general perception was in flux, as some maps were reformulated to reflect\n    newly discovered landmasses, while goods\u2014even people\u2014arrived in Florence\n    through Medici connections and gift exchange.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn43"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref43"\n        title=""\n>[43]</a\n>\n    In painting the armory ceiling to supplement the weapons on display, Ludovico\n    Buti was responding to the New World context as framed by Medici court\n    culture.\n</p>\n<p>\n    As Eviatar Zerubavel argues, Vespucci was one of few pundits who set the\n    precedent for the intellectual shift of imagining and depicting the New World\n    as a separate landmass from Asia.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn44"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref44"\n        title=""\n>[44]</a\n>\n    Why, then, did the Medici continue to reference imagery that continued to\n    conflate the two continents, in turn depicting an ambiguous amalgam of\n    cultures on the armory ceiling? Due to the ubiquitous nature of these widely\n    known prints disseminated within the court, narrative and ethnographic\n    pictorial representations were slower to follow suit. The Medici embraced\n    these anachronistic tendencies by using them as references in their imagery.\n    Even maps such as those contained in Ortelius\u2019s atlas that separated the\n    continents weren\u2019t entirely confident that America wasn\u2019t part of Asia.\n    Further, the Medici family\u2019s liberal practice of categorizing objects, coupled\n    with the fluid definition of the word \u201cIndian,\u201d helped build an environment in\n    which projection of the New World mirrored the Old, lightly grasping at\n    Ptolemaic tradition. Thus, the idea of a continent of America untouched by\n    Asia was slow to formulate even in Medici Florence where Vespucci carried a\n    legacy. The armory was a commission by a powerful Ducal family in the midst of\n    establishing its identity not only among dignitaries from Spain and Portugal\n    who had a hand in New World exploration, but also within a shifting worldview\n    that required revisions of its classical antecedent.<a\n        href="#_weitzman_edn45"\n        name="_weitzman_ednref45"\n        title=""\n>[45]</a\n>\n    The result is a representation of a New World that is not completely divorced\n    from Asia, situated in a court culture that was simultaneously well aware of\n    Vespucci\u2019s innovative observations of a separate New World. Thus the fresco is\n    an example of a hyper-local, as well as larger, continental identity in flux\u2014a\n    process of reconciliation of the anachronistic Ptolemaic ancient practice and\n    development of an understanding of a brand-new, largely unknown society across\n    the Atlantic. The Medici were working through what Zerubavel calls \u201cdenial\u201d\u2013\n    \u201ca way of resisting the unfamiliar by forcing it into familiar mental niches,\n    thereby practically denying its novelty or unusualness.\u201d </sup\n        ><a href="#_weitzman_edn46" name="_weitzman_ednref46" title=""\n>[46]</a\n>\n    A dichotomy existed between Francesco\u2019s desire to have agency in the discovery\n    of the New World and its profound implications on the early modern world. In\n    step with the loose categorization of Medici objects, appropriation of\n    multifarious New World prints and texts circulating throughout Europe, and the\n    atlases that situated the American landmass in the East, Ferdinando projected\n    an image of Amerasia on the armory ceiling that the Medici court would have\n    expected to see.\n</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n\x3c!--<h3>Bibliography</h3>--\x3e\n\x3c!--<p>--\x3e\n\x3c!--    Boone, Elizabeth Hill. \u201cSeeking Indianness: Christoph Weiditz, the Aztecs, and--\x3e\n\x3c!--    Feathered Amerindians.\u201d <i>Colonial Latin American Review</i>, vol. 26, no. 1,--\x3e\n\x3c!--    2017, pp. 39\u201361.--\x3e\n\x3c!--</p>--\x3e\n\x3c!--<p>--\x3e\n\x3c!--    Davies, Surekha.--\x3e\n\x3c!--    <i--\x3e\n\x3c!--    >Renaissance Ethnography and the Invention of the Human: New Worlds, Maps--\x3e\n\x3c!--        and Monsters</i--\x3e\n\x3c!--    >.

However, cartographic representations of China still followed the\n  conventions of the genre of the fifteenth century that were inherited from\n  Marco Polo\u2019s accounts of China. Tangut (Northwestern China), Cathay (Northern\n  China), and Mangi (Southern China), the three main destinations on Polo\u2019s\n  itinerary in China, were upheld as the three main toponyms used to represent\n  China in sixteenth century world maps, while \u201cCanton\u201d, the most important port\n  city for Portuguese travelers in the sixteenth century, had not yet been shown\n  in those maps.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> At first\n  glance it seems the cartographic representation of China remained intact, but\n  if we look closer at the toponyms in its surroundings we begin to see that the\n  representation of its geographical relationship with the New World did change.\n</p>\n<p>\n  By pointing out how several toponyms moved around the Old World reference\n  points &mdash;Cathay, Tangut, and Mangi&mdash; in a series of maps, I aim to\n  show how Europeans reconfigured their conceptions of the world\u2019s expansiveness\n  and the distinctive ways that they imagined Amerasia. The main body of the\n  essay is divided into three sections corresponding to the categorization of\n  ten selected maps. While two body sections contain different manifestations of\n  Amerasia, the Amerasian phenomenon is absent in the remaining one. Next, this\n  essay will examine how <i>The Travels of Marco Polo </i>contributed to two\n  types of Amerasian maps.\n</p>\n<h3>The Amerasian phenomenon near The Tropic of Cancer</h3>\n<p>\n  The first type of sixteenth-century world map, which has the greatest number\n  of surviving copies, represents Asia and what we now call North America as one\n  single landmass and portrays South America as an extension of Asia. It also\n  shows the Amerasian phenomenon near the Tropic of Cancer by placing the\n  toponyms of the New World (Cuba, or Temixtitan) next to the Asian toponyms\n  (Chinpagu, or Mangi).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Francesco Rosselli\u2019s 1508 marine chart of the world manifests Columbus\u2019\n  cosmographical belief that he had arrived in Asia by listing the place names\n  originally designated by Columbus in his fourth voyage along the coast of\n  Nicaragua to Eastern Panama, today known as Central America, along the east\n  coast of Asia. <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2"> [2] </a>\n</p>\n<img src="wu-images/image001.jpg" width="100%" alt="Map used in maritime" />\n<p>\n  Fig 1. Francesco Rosselli, Marine Chart of the World, 1508. In\n  <i>Terra Cognita: The Mental Discovery of America</i>, by Eviatar Zerubavel.\xa0\n  New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press, 1992, plate 13.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <i>The Travels of Marco Polo</i> influenced Columbus\u2019s cosmographical\n  conceptualization. Since Marco Polo had expanded the eastern end of the island\n  of the Earth by exploring the immense Chinese provinces of Cathay and Mangi,\n  along with an adjacent archipelago and the great island of Cipangu, Columbus\n  gained the impression that the intervening ocean between the western shores of\n  Europe and the eastern shores of Asia were not very great, leading him to\n  convince the Spanish court to allow him to sail west to India. As soon as he\n  sighted land sometime between the eleventh and twelfth of October, 1492, he\n  was sure he had arrived in Asia.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a>\n  Whatever he saw during the rest of his exploration he interpreted as empirical\n  evidence of this fixed belief. Here we have to bear in mind that\n  <i>The Travels of Marco Polo</i> did not serve as textual evidence for\n  Columbus to prove that land was Asia; rather, it served as a formulation in\n  Columbus\u2019s mind which was so deep-rooted that it made him consistently align\n  his exploration along the coast of the New Land with Marco Polo\u2019s return trip\n  from Zaiton to Europe.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> [4] </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n  In the Gilt Globe (1528), while \u201cTangut\u201d is placed on the Northwest side of\n  \u201cCathay\u201d and \u201cMangi\u201d on the south, \u201cHispania Nova\u201d indicates the territory of\n  New Spain at the center of the triangle formed by \u201cTangut\u201d, \u2018Cathay\u201c and\n  \u201cMangi\u201d. \u201cTemixtitan\u201d is depicted right above \u201cMangi\u201d. In terms of Oronce\n  Fin\xe9\u2019s map (1534), \u201cTemixtitan\u201d (Tenochtitlan) and \u201cMessigo\u201d(Mexico) are\n  regional names in the province of Mangi.\n</p>\n<p><img width="100%" src="wu-images/image002.jpg" /></p>\n\n<p>\n  Fig. 2 Unknown, Noua et integri universi orbis descriptio (The Paris Glit or\n  De Bure Globe), 1528.\n</p>\n\n<p><img border="0" width="100%" src="wu-images/image003.jpg" /></p>\n\n<p>\n  Fig. 3 Oronce Fin\xe9, <i> Recens et integra orbis descriptio, </i>1534, National\n  Library of France.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Similarly, in Giovanni Vavassore\'s copy (1558) of Caspar Vopel\u2019s world map\n  (1545)<u>, </u>\u201cHispania Nova\u201d appears underneath \u201cMangi\u201d. From the map we can\n  tell that \u201cTemixtitan\u201d is also located in the southeast towards \u201cMangi\u201d, but\n  further southeast than in Fin\xe9\u2019s map.\n</p>\n<p><img border="0" width="100%" src="wu-images/image004.jpg" /></p>\n\n<p>\n  Fig. 4 Caspar Vopel, <i>Nova et integra universalisque orbis totius,</i> 1558,\n  Harvard University Library.\n</p>\n<h3>An absence of Amerasia</h3>\n<p>\n  The second type of world map experiments with a total separateness between\n  Asia and today\u2019s American continent. For example, the Waldseem\xfcller map (1507)\n  is the first to portray America\u2019s insular nature and its absolute separateness\n  from Asia. On the right side of the map, Tangut, Cathay, and Mangi run along\n  the eastern coast of Asia from north to south.

The development of world\n  maps in the sixteenth century could not be seen as a teleological process\n  where a much clearer picture of the modern worldview came into being over\n  time. Instead, it was a period when plural worldviews driven by different\n  ideologies co-existed and reshaped each other during the sixteenth century.\n  While Amerasia was a dominant worldview in the sixteenth century, it did\n  adjust and rearrange itself, responding to the challenges posed by its\n  opposite side &mdash;the maps showing the hypothesis that Asia and the New\n  World were separated from one another. Meanwhile, even maps or mapmakers that\n  experimented with a two-continent vision were subject to changing their minds,\n  as Waldseem\xfcller reverted to an Amerasian vision of the world in his 1516\n  Carta Marina. Furthermore, sometimes even when maps separated the continents,\n  they still embraced an Amerasian view.\n</p>\n<h3>The Amerasian phenomenon in the North</h3>\n<p>\n  After Waldseem\xfcller, many began to accept that South America was a New World,\n  but the North American connection to Asia persisted. In the middle of the\n  sixteenth century there emerged a third type of world map which separated the\n  east coast of Asia from the lower part of today\u2019s North America with a vast\n  ocean.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In response to this trend of separating Asia from today\u2019s North America in the\n  area around the Tropic of Cancer, the Amerasian phenomenon persisted by\n  spreading northward. The displacement of several Asian toponyms around Cathay,\n  such as Ania and Toloman, plays an essential role in displaying Amerasia\u2019s new\n  form at the stage when China was no longer intermingled with Mexico.<a\n    href="#_edn5"\n    name="_ednref5"\n    title=""\n  >\n    [5]\n  </a>\n  According to Marco Polo, Toloman was an Asian kingdom in southwestern China\n  abundant in gold. When he was sent to travel west by the Great Khan, Polo\n  visited Toloman on his return voyage after passing through Tibet and reported\n  that it was near India.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""> [6] </a>\n  Among the maps that have been introduced, the Behaim globe (1492), the Ruysch\n  map (1507), and the Waldseem\xfcller map (1507) all placed Toloman next to\n  Cathay.\n</p>\n<p><img border="0" width="100%" src="wu-images/image005.jpg" /></p>\n\n<p>\n  Fig. 7 Johan Ruysch, Detail of a view of the globe, 1507.

This move\n  was triggered by a new version of <i>The Travels of Marco Polo</i> published\n  by Giovanni Battista Ramusio in 1556.

The entire gulf is bounded on the southeast side by the\n  province of Manzi and on the other side by Ania and Toloman, besides many\n  other provinces\u2026This gulf is very large, and so many\xa0people live there that it\n  seems almost (like) another world.\u201d<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""\n    >[8]\n  </a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n  In <i>The Venetian Discovery of the World</i>, Elizabeth Horodowich argues\n  that it is Ramusio that encouraged Gastaldi to understand that Toloman was \u201con\n  the other side\u201d of this large gulf, in \u201canother world,\u201d a New World. The\n  placement of toponyms mentioned in <i>The Travel of Marco Polo, </i>such as\n  Tolman in the New World, emphasized the New World\u2019s connection to the Venetian\n  historical figure, which reflected how Venetians positioned themselves in the\n  exploration of the New World even if they didn\u2019t physically participate in the\n  age of discoveries.\n</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>\n  Marco Polo\u2019s exploration of the Land of the East unfolded around Cathay, and\n  his itinerary provided the basic geographical knowledge of East Asia, serving\n  as an established textual source for European cartographers to depict China on\n  world maps from the late fourteenth century.<a\n    href="#_edn9"\n    name="_ednref9"\n    title=""\n  >\n    [9]\n  </a>\n  In the sixteenth century, as the European Age of Encounters unfolded\n  concurrently with the print revolution, accounts of Columbian voyages were\n  disseminated around Europe with his point of view of seeing the New World and\n  Asia as one.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""> [10] </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n  Marco Polo\u2019s effect on Columbus\u2019 cosmographical concepts contributed to the\n  pervasiveness of a series of Amerasian maps that depict today\u2019s Mexican Gulf\n  and China Sea as one and place Mexico within the land of Asia throughout the\n  sixteenth century. But in the second half of the sixteenth century, there was\n  a tendency for more maps separating these two regions at a great distance.\n</p>\n<p>\n  However, this perceived separation did not mean that the Amerasian phenomenon\n  no longer existed in this group of maps. The publication of a new edition of\n  <i>The Travels of Marco Polo </i>published by Ramusio in the 1550s pushed the\n  Amerasian phenomenon into a new form in the north, responding to the maps that\n  separate Asia and the New World in the area near the Tropic of Cancer. When\n  European cartographers expressed the idea of Amerasia they could either\n  squeeze some toponyms of the New World into Asia, as they did in the region\n  near the Tropic of Cancer, or they could extend some Asian toponyms, like\n  Toloman, towards the other side of world, as they did in the North.\n</p>\n\n<hr />\n<div id="edn1">\n  <p>\n    <a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title=""> [1]</a>  Serge Gruzinski mentions\n    that although the Portuguese had reached the Chinese coast by 1513, sailing\n    form Malacca.

By the 15th century, one of the kings was frequently shown as\n    African, and as Europeans continued to explore the larger world, images of the\n    Magi reveal shifting ideas of time and place.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a> As the first gentiles\n    to\n    worship Christ, the Magi are not only precursors to European Christians, but\n    also potential models for non-European converts to Christianity.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Visual representations of the Magi provide a valuable lens for considering how\n    early modern artists and viewers might have understood the changing geography\n    of the world around them. This essay begins from a self-consciously modern\n    perspective of what constitutes an \'American\' magus, progressively expanding\n    this category to consider images which early modern viewers might have\n    understood as \'Amerasian.\' By beginning from a modern worldview and\n    systematically shifting its parameters, it is possible to explore the varied\n    and flexible ways in which American iconography is incorporated with other\n    geographic references, and thus consider the range of ways in which early\n    modern Europeans might have understood the Magi in relation to the New World.\n</p>\n<p>\n    An early sixteenth-century <i>Adoration of the Magi</i> attributed to Vasco\n    Fernandes (Figure 1) is the touchstone of scholarly discussions about an\n    American Magus. The figures crowd in the foreground: the Madonna sits with the\n    Christ Child on her lap behind a low parapet, and the three Magi approach her\n    from the left. The eldest king kneels with his hat off and his hands clasped\n    in prayer; he has already given his gift, which the Virgin now passes to\n    Joseph. Behind him stand the other two Magi, one removing his hat in\n    reverence, the other striding forward and holding out his gift. It is this\n    third Magus who has captured scholarly attention. His feather headdress and\n    the arrow he holds have been convincingly identified with the Tupinamba people\n    of Brazil, first encountered by the Portuguese explorer Pedro Alvares Cabral\n    in 1500, shortly before the date of Fernandes\' painting.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Joseph Koerner and others have noted that this connection to Portuguese\n    exploration is crucial for understanding the painting and its inclusion of an\n    American Magus. Indeed, Fernandes\' painting was part of an altar retable for\n    the cathedral of Viseu, Cabral\'s hometown, and the third king\'s telltale\n    iconography&#8212;the headdress with colorful parrot feathers&#8212;stems\n    directly from accounts of the people encountered on this voyage.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11"\n                                                                       title="">[11]</a> Yet the figure is\n    clothed, in a striking departure from the European descriptions of naked\n    natives they had encountered in the New World. This has previously been\n    explained in terms of theological necessity, in that it would breach all rules\n    of decorum to show a nude Magus.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a> Koerner goes further,\n    arguing also that clothing served also as a means of \'taming\' the figure, much\n    as Cabral attempted to do by introducing some of the Tupinamba he encountered\n    to European customs.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13] </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    In an attempt to step outside of this unidirectional model of European\n    hegemony attempting to \'civilize\' the Tupinamba, it is worth considering the\n    ways in which foreignness and familiarity are productively held in tension.\n    The fundamental difference of the Tupinamba Magus\'s featherwork keeps him from\n    being wholly assimilated, but the addition of clothing resembling a doublet\n    and knee breeches allows him to enter into European representational\n    conventions rather than being just an exotic \'other.\'<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a> These\n    two systems of\n    clothing (and of cultural coding) are in fact melded, rather than simply being\n    overlaid: the Tupinamba feathers are intermingled with the figure\'s\n    Europeanizing clothing, incorporated around the edges of the figure\'s doublet.<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a> The Tupinamba Magus\n    strides into representation and recognizability, his Europeanized garb\n    bringing him just close enough to a Portuguese visual language for his\n    foreignness to be comprehensible.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Cabral\'s voyage to Brazil also opens geographic&#8212;as well as\n    cultural&#8212;questions. His landfall in Brazil was accidental: he intended\n    to sail around the Cape of Good Hope to reach India, but went off course in\n    the tropics, resulting in his brief sojourn in Brazil before returning across\n    the Atlantic to complete his original voyage.<a\n        href="#_edn16"\n        name="_ednref16"\n        title=""\n>[16]</a>\n    While to modern viewers, Brazil and West Africa are two fundamentally\n    different locations separated by the Atlantic Ocean, early 16th century\n    navigators did not yet have a means of calculating longitude. Instead, they\n    divided the world latitudinally into polar zones, temperate zones, and\n    tropical zones.<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a> For\n    Cabral&#8212;and for Fernandes&#8212;it would be logical to draw parallels\n    between different peoples living in the tropics. Indeed, Fernandes depicts the\n    third Magus with some of the features common to African figures: his short\n    textured hair and his dark skin, as well as his earring and jewelry, could\n    also be associated with Africa.<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a>\n    Additionally, rather than including both an African Magus and a New World\n    Magus, the Tupinamba figure supplants his African predecessor. Here, then,\n    similitude is sufficient to justify substitution.\n</p>\n<p>\n    It is also worth considering how replacing an African Magus&#8212;who by this\n    point had become a staple of Magian imagery&#8212;with a New World Magus\n    reshapes the understanding of the Three Kings arriving <i>\'ab oriente,\'</i> from the\n    east. For Fernandes, working in Portugal, much of Africa was to the east, and\n    yet Portuguese explorers reached Africa by sailing south. Relative to\n    Bethlehem, where the nativity of Christ occurred, most of Africa is south and\n    west. Though the Horn of Africa extends further east than the Holy Land,\n    traveling from East Africa to Bethlehem would still predominantly be a\n    northward journey. Prester John&#8212;understood as a descendant of one of the\n    Magi&#8212;was often situated in East Africa, but on the Vopel Map at least he\n    appears in Abassia, directly south of the Holy Land.<a\n        href="#_edn19"\n        name="_ednref19"\n        title=""\n>[19]</a>\n    [<a href="#pivar-presterjohn">See the essay on Prester John by Larimore Pivar</a>] An African Magus, then, is\n    difficult to comprehend as coming from the east, which perhaps enables this\n    figure to be replaced in the Viseu altarpiece with an American Magus, who\n    similarly complicates a directional understanding of the Magi.\n</p>\n<p>\n    An Amerasian worldview, particularly at the beginning of the 16th century,\n    could sustain the possibility that Brazil marked a point at which east and\n    west meet. If New World was understood as being connected to East Asia&#8212;a\n    worldview that is wholly supported by the Vopel Map&#8212;it is possible that\n    a Magus from Brazil could have made an immensely long land journey across the\n    New World and Asia to reach Bethlehem.<a\n        href="#_edn20"\n        name="_ednref20"\n        title=""\n>[20]</a>\n    From a European vantage point, however, people in the New World were reached\n    by traveling west, not east&#8212;a distinction which is particularly\n    important for the Portuguese and Spanish, who used this directional model to\n    determine their mercantile and colonial powers over any lands discovered by\n    sea.<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[21]</a> Two-dimensional\n    cartographic representations also echo this directionality: although a land\n    voyage would be possible given the geographic configuration of the Vopel Map,\n    its organization of the world onto a flat plane nonetheless situates Brazil to\n    the west of Jerusalem. The Cantino Planisphere (<a\n        href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Cantino_planisphere_%281502%29.jpg"\n>here</a\n>), created just after Cabral\'s voyage and reflecting his new discoveries,\n    also situates Brazil to the west. In this representation, the western end of\n    Brazil is left undetermined, and it is uncertain whether a land route\n    traveling westward would even be possible.\n</p>\n<p>\n    An anonymous Bolognese painting of the <i>Adoration of the Magi</i> (<a\n        href="http://catalogo.fondazionezeri.unibo.it/scheda.v2.jsp?locale=en&amp;decorator=layout_resp&amp;apply=true&amp;tipo_scheda=F&amp;id=83108&amp;titolo=Anonimo+-+Anonimo+bolognese+-+sec.+XVI+-+Adorazione+dei+Re+Magi+-+insieme"\n        target="_blank">here</a\n>), dating to the mid to late 16th century, again implies an Amerasian\n    worldview in which someone from the New World could have traveled to see the\n    infant Christ. Here, however, the figure in question is not one of the three\n    kings presenting their gifts before the Madonna and Child in the center\n    foreground (<a\n        href="http://catalogo.fondazionezeri.unibo.it/scheda.v2.jsp?locale=en&amp;decorator=layout_resp&amp;apply=true&amp;tipo_scheda=F&amp;id=83111&amp;titolo=Anonimo+-+Anonimo+bolognese+-+sec.+XVI+-+Adorazione+dei+Re+Magi+-+particolare"\n        target="_blank">here</a\n>). These kings reveal a range of skin tones and geographical markers, and can\n    plausibly be identified as a kneeling East Asian king who gazes up at the\n    Christ Child who blesses him, a dark-skinned African king with a turban, and\n    another turbaned king with a beard who is likely Near Eastern.<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title=""> [22] </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    One of the figures in the midground at the left of the panel (<a\n        href="http://catalogo.fondazionezeri.unibo.it/scheda.v2.jsp?locale=en&amp;decorator=layout_resp&amp;apply=true&amp;tipo_scheda=F&amp;id=83110&amp;titolo=Anonimo+-+Anonimo+bolognese+-+sec.+XVI+-+Corteo+dei+Re+Magi+-+particolare"\n        target="_blank">here</a\n>), however, appears to be wearing a feathered headdress and other feathered\n    decoration around his neck, attire which strikingly resembles the woodcut\n    images of cannibals made to illustrate an account of the discoveries of\n    Amerigo Vespucci (Figure 2). Though it is currently impossible to identify the\n    animal he is riding, the figure holds a heraldic trumpet, suggesting that he\n    is a part of the entourage of one of the Three Kings. This seems to support\n    the belief that the people of the New World were, in fact, inhabitants of\n    Asia. The feathered figure here, then, must be understood as both a figure\n    from the New World and the subject of an East Asian monarch. While to modern\n    eyes, this appears to be an erroneous conflation of America and Asia,\n    understanding the painting on its own historical terms allows both of these\n    identities to coexist within the same figure. As the Vopel Map attests,\n    portions of East Asia known to Marco Polo and the newly discovered New World\n    were sufficiently proximate geographically to justify the presence of a New\n    World figure in the retinue of a far eastern king.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The other set of Magian images which, to our modern perspective, clearly\n    include figures from the New World are paintings created in the Americas.\n    Trexler notes that particularly in the Andean region around modern Peru,\n    European colonizers of the early 16th century sought evidence that\n    Christianity had already reached the New World in antiquity, including suggesting the possibility of a Native American Magus.<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[23]</a> A 17th\n    century Peruvian\n    painting by Diego de la Puente visualizes this possibility, showing one of the\n    Magi in the robes and headdress of an Incan king (<a\n        href="https://preview.redd.it/kvlncjnjql101.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04faf8eac1df70c5d6b0646654e5925f34353f65"\n        target="_blank">here</a\n>).<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title="">[24]</a> Unlike European\n    images with New World figures, the inclusion of an Incan Magus here is most\n    likely motivated by practical and propagandistic reasons. In the Andes,\n    depicting three Magi from the Old World (for instance, an African figure, an\n    Ottoman figure, and a Chinese figure) would have been all but unintelligible\n    to most non-Europeans. The inclusion of an Incan Magus&#8212;particularly in\n    conjunction with an African Magus, who would also represent a potentially\n    recognizable physiognomic type, given the rise of Atlantic slave trade&#8212;makes the painting more accessible and comprehensible to its\n    immediate audience. The Incan Magus could also serve as a model for native\n    peoples, who could be directed to emulate this painted figure in their own\n    devotion to Christ.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The paintings discussed above all contain figures who can be convincingly\n    associated with the New World, suggesting that the route of the Magi passed\n    through America. Such clear examples, however, are rare. Does this scarcity\n    reflect a lack of interest among early modern Europeans in depicting New World\n    Magi, or does it reflect the narrowness of our current definition of\n    \'American\'?</p>\n<p>\n    An Amerasian worldview could broaden this inquiry to also consider figures\n        whose foreignness may include or refer to the New World, but in conjunction\n        with areas that we now see as different geographic regions such as India and\n        Africa. These images are particularly intriguing because of the flexibility\n        of the term \'India\' in the early modern period, variously encompassing East\n        Africa, areas of South and East Asia, and the West Indies. <a\n            href="#riccio-india" target="_blank">[See the essay on India and Indians by Vittoria\n        Riccio]</a>\n        Figures that appear to modern scholars to contain mixed iconography might have\n        been originally intended to represent inhabitants of a greater India. To our\n        eyes, the connections between the subsequent images and the New World appear\n        more tenuous, but for some early modern viewers this iconography might have\n        resonated with imagery from both the Old World and the New.\n</p>\n<p>\n    A particularly rich subject for this avenue of investigation is Francisco de\n    Holanda\'s <i> Adoration of the Magi</i> (<a\n        href="http://bdh-rd.bne.es/viewer.vm?id=0000137315&amp;page=86"\n        target="_blank">here</a\n>), from his <i>De aetatibus mundi imagines</i>, a collection of cosmological\n    drawings from the Creation to the Apocalypse. The three Magi kneel at the\n    right of the page, each modeling a different form of devotion toward the\n    seated Virgin and the Child she holds. The foremost Magus presses his hands to\n    the ground, his face down; this particular posture of worship, in conjunction\n    with the curved sword at his side, may suggest a Near Eastern figure. The\n    second Magus, who is also elderly and bearded, bows down much like his\n    companion. His hands, however, are clasped in a European gesture of prayer,\n    and his face remains turned toward the Madonna and Christ. If the Magus at the\n    front appears to visualize an Islamic gesture of prayer, the second Magus is\n    more reminiscent of medieval and Byzantine donor portraits, in a pose of\n    <i>proskynesis</i> or veneration.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Unlike the foremost two Magi, whose very similar physiognomies, clothing, and\n    poses offer only a suggestion of their geographic origins, the third Magus\n    provides an entire range of potentially locatable iconography. The features of\n    this Magus and of his followers&#8212;one depicted frontally, and another\n    shown in profile, as though providing a full range of views with which to be\n    able to understand these figures&#8212;are similar to those given to African\n    Magi, as seen in a painting by D\xfcrer (<a\n        href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_-_L%27Adoration_des_mages.jpg"\n        target="_blank">here</a\n>). In addition to their prominent jaws and furrowed brows, these figures are\n    shown beardless with short curly hair, and they each wear earrings, all\n    attributes common to African figures.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The figure\'s bangles and headdress, however, point to very different\n    referents. The distinctive two-plume headdress is strikingly similar to one\n    worn by a figure on a Sri Lankan casket (<a\n        href="https://images.tribuneindia.com/cms/gall_content/2018/2/2018_2$largeimg15_Thursday_2018_223007377gallery.jpg"\n        target="_blank">here</a\n>), who also wears armbands and bracelets. As this casket was a gift from the\n    Sri Lankan ambassador to the Portuguese king, it is possible that Holanda\n    could have seen it and used it as a model, retaining just the headband and the\n    plumes of the Sri Lankan headdress.<a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title="">[25]</a> Figures with similar\n    bangles and headgear are depicted on the Indian subcontinent in the Portuguese\n    Miller Atlas, created in 1519 and illustrated by none other than Francisco de\n    Holanda\'s father Antonio (<a\n        href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b55002605w/f1.item.zoom"\n        target="_blank">here</a\n>). Another comparison could be made to representations of the Mesoamerican\n    ruler Moctezuma II (<a\n        href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Houghton_Typ_625.99.800_Istoria_della_conquista_del_Messico_-_Motezuma.jpg"\n        target="_blank">here</a\n>\n    and\n    <a\n            href="https://www.gettyimages.co.nz/detail/illustration/portrait-of-montezuma-ii-tecnochtitlan-last-king-of-stock-graphic/540779689"\n            target="_blank">here</a>), who also wears gold armbands and a headpiece with a plume to either side.\n    A typological resemblance between Holanda\'s Magus and the images of Moctezuma\n    also extends to clothing: both figures are shown seminude, with only a cloak\n    over their shoulders and another garment tied about their waists.\n</p>\n<p>\n    While these references read as fundamentally disparate to modern eyes, a\n    16th-century viewer might have understood them all as falling under the\n    umbrella of the \'Indies.\' A closer understanding of Holanda\'s perception of\n    art on global terms may also help in clarify these references. As Alessandra\n    Russo argues in a current project on Francisco de Holanda and artistic\n    universalism, his commentary in both his <i>Dialogues</i> with Michelangelo\n    and in <i>Da Pintura Antigua</i> reveals that he already attempted to theorize\n    art as a universal trait of humanity. This sort of thinking allowed him to\n    approach Mixtec pottery, for example, and understand it as being comparable to\n    ancient Greek pottery&#8212;indeed, to consider the possibility that the New\n    World had contact with Greco-Roman antiquity at some point in the past.<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title="">\n    [26]</a> This particular\n    parallel is especially important for the drawing. Unlike the first two Magi,\n    who are shown in attitudes of prayer, the third Magus is shown in the act of\n    offering his gift: he sets down a vessel before the Virgin and Child, which\n    looks strikingly like an ancient Greek shoulder lekythos (<a\n        href="https://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/tools/pottery/shapes/lekythos.htm"\n        target="_blank">here</a\n>). His two compatriots, kneeling behind him, also carry their offerings in\n    vessels, though these are more difficult to identify. It is possible that the\n    figure on the left may hold a pyxis, and the simpler vessel to the right may\n    be a krater, but here the parallels to Greek pottery are less distinct.\n</p>\n<p>\n    These vessels, then, may be a visualization of Holanda\'s concept of universal\n    antiquity. While the lekythos seems (at least to modern eyes) clearly\n    identifiable as a Greek vase, the other two slip away from recognizable types.\n    Perhaps the depiction of these vessels, offered by figures who are clearly\n    meant to be foreign&#8212;maybe even coming from as far as the New\n    World&#8212;was meant to suggest a universal antiquity, visualized through\n    their partial similarity to known Greco-Roman objects. Such an interpretation\n    might imply that Holanda saw these objects as evolutionarily linked: at some\n    point in the past, such as at the time when the Magi went to worship Christ,\n    Greek pottery could have been a universal standard.\n</p>\n<p>\n    It is also important to discuss a final category of images: Magi who are\n    depicted using the iconography of African figures, but with the addition of\n    feathered headwear. As Peter Mason aptly observes, feathers cannot\n    conclusively prove a connection to America, nor can their absence preclude\n    such a reference, since they appear both on Amerindian and Asian figures (and,\n    one might add, on the hats of European and African figures).<a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title="">[27]</a>\n    Since feather\n    decoration extends across our modern geographic categories, images of Magi\n    with feathers could provide a useful case study for considering whether an\n    Amerasian worldview is in play.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Albrecht D\xfcrer\'s 1504 painting of the <i>Adoration of the Magi</i> (<a\n        href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_-_L%27Adoration_des_mages.jpg"\n        target="_blank">here</a\n>), and his 1511 print of the same subject (<a\n        href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_-_The_Adoration_of_the_Magi_%28NGA_1943.3.3672%29.jpg"\n        target="_blank">here</a\n>) are particularly helpful for illustrating this phenomenon.<a\n        href="#_edn28"\n        name="_ednref28"\n        title=""\n>[28]</a>\n    In the painting, an African Magus&#8212;recognizable not only because of his\n    dark skin, but also marked by his prominent forehead, pronounced jaw, and\n    curly hair&#8212;holds an elaborate red hat, decorated with jewels and two\n    white feathers. Here, the hat is more prominent than its plumes; the feathers\n    are attached to it solely as a decoration, in the fashion of European caps. By\n    contrast, in D\xfcrer\'s 1511 print, the multiple textured feathers are the visual\n    focus of the hat held by the African Magus. This figure shares the same high\n    forehead, strong jaw, and short curly hair as the painted figure, making him\n    recognizably African despite his European garments, replete with slashed\n    sleeves. A 17th century painting of the <i>Adoration of the Magi</i> by Juan\n    Bautista Maino also includes an African Magus whose headdress is overwhelmed\n    by feathers (<a\n        href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Fray_Juan_Bautista_Maino_-_Adoration_of_the_Kings_-_WGA13870.jpg"\n        target="_blank">here</a\n>).<a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title="">[29]</a> Though Maino\'s\n    African king appears to have a turban wrapped around his head, the white band\n    of fabric is fairly narrow, and crowned by brightly-colored feathers, like\n    those described by Europeans visiting the New World.<a\n        href="#_edn30"\n        name="_ednref30"\n        title=""\n>[30]\n</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    These final examples illustrate the difficulty of finding recognizably\n    \'American\' figures in early modern depictions of the Magi, and provide a test\n    case of how far an Amerasian paradigm can be applied to art. Did early modern\n    viewers understand all of these figures&#8212;and perhaps also Magi who we\n    today identify as Far Eastern&#8212;as being \'Amerasian,\' coming from a place\n    where east and west meet? Or, conversely, does the relative scarcity of\n    conclusive visual references to the New World suggest that most artists\n    understood America as a different location to the west, from which the eastern\n    Magi could not have come?\n</p>\n<p>\n    In the absence of clear textual sources from artists or viewers of these\n    images, this is impossible to determine&#8212;indeed, both of these worldviews\n    were probably sustained simultaneously, as a result of unequal access to new\n    geographic information. The four paintings which incontrovertibly reference\n    the Americas each come from particular contexts where artists could have\n    obtained privileged knowledge of the New World: Fernandes painted in the\n    hometown of the Portuguese explorer of Brazil, the Bolognese painting comes\n    from the city where Charles V and Clement VII met to discuss the implications\n    of European exploration, and the two Peruvian paintings originate in the New\n    World itself. Holanda, too, had unique access to information about Portuguese\n    travel both eastward and westward. It is possible that for such artists, an\n    Amerasian worldview suggested the importance of relating the Magi to the New\n    World, while for other artists the Americas did not figure into the story of\n    the Magi at all.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Ultimately, these images are most useful for highlighting the complexity of\n    early modern depictions of the Magi. They point to the importance of\n    reconsidering our own modern geographic categories, so as to begin to\n    understand the shifting world that European painting sought to visualize.\n</p>\n\n<hr>\n   <p>\n        <a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[1]</a> The label reads \'Tharssis\n        R[egio] / Hinc Melchiore[m] Ma / gu[m] p[ro]drisse [<i>sic</i> prodisse]\n        ferunt\' (Kingdom of Tharssis / They report that the Magus Melchior went\n        forth from here).

In tracing the history of \xd4<i\n>India\xd5</i\n>\n    and its derivatives in the Italian language, it will immediately appear clear\n    that we are dealing with a fluid and multifaceted term that overcomes the\n    boundaries of its most immediate meaning. The origin of the word has a\n    geographical nature: it derives from the Greek <i>&#7992;</i\n><i>&#957;&#948;&#943;</i><i>&#945; </i>(<i>India</i>)<i>, </i>which indicated\n    the land of the Indus River (<i>Sindhu </i>in Sanskrit, <i>Hindu</i> in Old\n    Persian); the people inhabiting those regions were called <i>&#7992;</i\n><i>&#957;&#948;&#959;&#943;</i> (<i>Indoi</i>). In its Latin form,\n    <i>India</i> transmigrated into Italian vernaculars and was often used as an\n    attribute for precious goods, such as minerals and pigments.<a\n        href="#_edn1"\n        name="_ednref1"\n        title=""\n>[1]</a\n>\n    Since Antiquity, India represented an <i>other</i> place, a remote land\n    inhabited by monsters and bizarre creatures in the minds of the Ancient\n    Greeks, or the location of Terrestrial Paradise in the Middle Ages. These two\n    extremes speak about a distance that is not only spatial, and that makes India\n    a fantastic repository of supernatural otherness. The traditional \xd2confusion\xd3\n    between India and Ethiopia perfectly exemplifies this tendency.<a\n        href="#_edn2"\n        name="_ednref2"\n        title=""\n>[2]</a\n>\n</p>\n<p>\n    The discovery of the New World marks the beginning of a new life for \xd4<i\n>India\xd5; </i\n>the sixteenth century represents, in fact, the apex of this longstanding\n    philological disorder. It is well known how Christopher Columbus, certain he\n    had landed in Marco Polo\xd5s Orient, became the first player in a linguistic\n    misunderstanding that still persists today. A visual example can be observed\n    in world maps and globes from the sixteenth century that concretely show the\n    ubiquity of India; in Caspar Vopel\xd5s World Map, for instance, we find several\n    <i>Indie</i>, disseminated around Asia, America and Africa. It is important,\n    however, to separate the historical \xd2error\xd3 from the linguistic and cultural\n    one; the former, resolved in a few decades with Vespucci\xd5s famed intuition,\n    was only the spark that gave life to the latter.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The five editions of the <i>Vocabolario</i\n><i> degli Accademici della Crusca</i> are the perfect tool to investigate\n    this evolution. The last publication describes India as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    From the well-known regions of Asia and America designated by this name, and\n    rich of rare and precious products, India, and more often the plural Indies\n    denotes, informally and figuratively, Great abundance of any thing, or any\n    thing that is necessary, and sometimes even \xd4Good fortune\xd5, \xd4Wealth\xd5, \xd4Source\n    of wealth\xd5 and more; and it is used as \xd4Having India or the Indies\xd5, \xd4Being\n    there India or Indies\xd5, \xd4Finding the Indies\xd5 [\xc9] \xa4 II. To come from the Indies\n    means to come from remote places with customs and uses different from ours;\n    and jokingly applied to those who do not know, or seem to ignore, the customs,\n    or famous facts, of the place where they arrive, or where they are.\n    <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    This definition is permeated by a sense of flexibility that speaks to us about\n    the multivalence of the term. India is not only a country, it is an entity\n    (link to India Extra Gangem entry).<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""\n>[4]</a\n>\n    The geographical indicators only serve to blur its physical borders; Asia and\n    America play an equal role in shaping its identity. India is a synonym for\n    Wealth and Abundance and, at the same time, a remote land that is\n    unquestionably different from us. The term becomes a container for any sort of\n    thing, almost a shape-shifting body that adapts, from time to time, to our\n    needs. We will see, however, how this apparently universal and fixed value is,\n    indeed, more subtle, precise and variegated.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The entry for \xd4<i>indiano</i><i>\xd5</i> provides interesting material as well:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    Properly used as \xd4of India or the Indies\xd5, \xd4Belonging to the Indies\xd5; and said\n    of a person \xd4Native of the Indies\xd5; and informally in the manner of \xd4<i\n>Fare l\xd5indiano\xd5</i\n>\n    (\xd4Acting like an Indian\xd5), which means pretending to ignore what one knows\n    about acts, facts, or persons, practices, manipulations and more; almost to\n    make it seem to be from the Indies, or another very distant place and\n    therefore not informed at all of the things of the country. Same as \xd4Fare il\n    nesci\xd5 or \xd4Fare lo gnorri\xd5 [\xc9].\n    <a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    The idea of distance returns in this second definition, especially in the\n    idiom \xd4<i>fare l\xd5indiano</i>\xd5 or \xd4to pretend to ignore something as if you\n    were coming from such a remote land that you could not be informed of the\n    facts of this country\xd5. The definition of the <i>Vocabolario</i>, however,\n    oddly overlooks the consideration of the Indian diffused in the sixteenth\n    century. The travel literature, the letters, and the accounts of the explorers\n    all agree on defining the indigenous populations of the Americas as shy,\n    timid, and na\u2022ve,<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> an idea\n    that easily translates into a negative conception of the <i>indio</i>, which\n    becomes a synonym of uncultured, pagan, and savage.\n    <a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a> <i>\xd4Indiano</i>\xd5 and\n    <i>\xd4fare l\xd5indiano</i>\xd5 evoke the same idea of remoteness enclosed in the\n    definition of <i>India</i>, but at the same time they imply a moral and\n    cultural judgement. Curiously, the idiom stimulates a question that contains\n    in itself the first germs of the Amerasian problem: which <i>indiano</i> are\n    we referring to? The reference to the na\u2022vet\u017d inevitably points at the\n    Amerindians, but the \xd4faraway land\xd5 corresponds to the Indies, East or West we\n    cannot know.\n</p>\n<p>\n    One last observation on the <i>Vocabolario</i> regards chronology. The entries\n    discussed above only appear in the fifth edition, published between 1843 and\n    1923, and they are still valid today. Therefore, we are discussing a\n    relatively recent definition, and this raises a series of questions on the use\n    of the term in the sixteenth century and the origin of the insightful\n    description that we find in the nineteenth century. The only obvious mention\n    of India, present since the first edition of 1612, is the term \xd4<i>indico</i\n><i>\xd5.</i> <a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a> This eloquent\n    absence, however, is not translated into an equivalent silence: \xd4<i>India\xd5 </i\n>and \xd4<i>indiano</i><i>\xd5 </i>populate the vocabulary, infiltrating the\n    definitions of many terms, from \xd4<i>gallo</i>\xd5 to \xd4<i>pepe</i>\xd5, to\n    \xd4<i>caldo</i>\xd5 and \xd4<i>tamarindi</i>\xd5. The occurrence of such attributes,\n    moreover, multiplies from one publication to the other, to the extreme cases\n    of \xd4<i>poleggio</i><i>\xd5 </i>and \xd4<i>porcellino</i>\xd5, in which reference to\n    India appears only in the fourth edition (1729-38) and is supplemented by a\n    rather longer definition. The use of India as an attribute is a clear allusion\n    to the ideas of abundance and distance and it refers, at the same time, to the\n    various historical conception related to it. The natural abundance of the\n    Garden of Eden, for instance, or the tales of mythical reigns refulgent of\n    gold and silver <a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a> could have\n    explained, in the Western mind, the profusion of products flooding the\n    European markets. (On the mapping of Paradise, see the entry on DRACONIS). It\n    is not surprising, then, that the nomenclature <i>\xd4d\xd5India\xd5 </i>or\n    <i>\xd4delle Indie</i>\xd5 was applied to plants, fruits, animals and luxury goods,\n    especially if we consider the mercantile culture of the Italian peninsula,\n    whose contacts with the East were mainly commercial. After 1492, the arrival\n    of American goods in Europe encountered this sort of mentality, which resulted\n    in an extension of the nomenclature to these new products. Whether West or\n    East Indies, these goods were coming from distant countries and therefore\n    their cost was higher; in this sense, \xd4<i>indiano</i>\xd5 acquires a further\n    semantic level, denoting more generally things with a non-European provenance,\n    or \xd4exotic.\xd5\n</p>\n<p>\n    A perfect example of the various uses of \xd4<i>India\xd5</i> and \xd5<i> indiano</i\n><i>\xd5 </i>is Giorgio Vasari. The first meaning we encounter is the simplest\n    one:reminiscent of medieval writers and contemporary merchants, he uses the\n    attribute \xd4<i>d\xd5India</i><i>\xd5 </i>or \xd4<i>indiano</i><i>\xd5</i> in reference to\n    animals.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a> In other cases,\n    Vasari indeed refers to the continent America, therefore using\n    <i>\xd4Indie\xd5 </i>with a precise geographical intent.\n</p>\n<p>\n    One example of this is the description of the Guardaroba in Palazzo Vecchio,\n    where Ignazio Danti painted \xd4the Tables of Ptolemy, all measured with perfect\n    accuracy and corrected after the most recent authorities, with exact charts of\n    navigation and their scales for measuring and degrees, done with supreme\n    diligence; and with these are all the names, both ancient and modern\xd5.<a\n        href="#_edn11"\n        name="_ednref11"\n        title=""\n>[11]</a\n>\n    The tables accurately described by Vasari depict the known world, which, he\n    tells us, is divided in four equal parts: Europe, Africa, Asia and the West\n    Indies.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a> The Indies are\n    mentioned again in relation to the portrait of Amerigo Vespucci \xd4who made the\n    voyages to the Indies,\xd5\n    <a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a> and one last time in the\n    description of the Palazzo degli Spini, in Florence:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    But to return to the space of the fa\x8dade which, turning from the straight, was\n    supported against the Palazzo degli Spini. In it was seen, painted in\n    chiaroscuro, a Nymph all unadorned and little less than nude, placed between\n    many new kinds of animals, who stood for the new land of Peru, with the other\n    new West Indies, discovered and ruled for the most part under the auspices of\n    the most fortunate House of Austria.<a\n        href="#_edn14"\n        name="_ednref14"\n        title=""\n>[14]</a\n>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    The recognition of the existence of a fourth part of the world, equal and\n    separated from the other continents, does not stop Vasari from using the word\n    \xd4<i>indiano</i>\xd5 in and ambiguous and fluid manner, sometimes as a mere\n    signifier for \xd4exotic\xd5 or \xd4foreign\xd5, sometimes charged with deeper meanings.\n    The idea of distance is present in his description of the\n    <a\n            href="https://www.uffizi.it/opere/adorazione-dei-magi-9f5c2075-8e8f-4883-b3ce-62fc6625a2b4#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=1"\n            target="_blank"\n    >Adoration of the Magi</a\n    >\n    (1496) by Filippino Lippi. The painting, commissioned by the friars of San\n    Donato Scopeto, illustrates the Augustinian tradition, specifically the\n    <i>Homilies </i>of Saint Augustine. According to the text, on that day Christ\n    was offered to the adoration of pagans, alluding to his mission as the Savior\n    of all the people of the world. The crowded scene is filled with Indians,\n    Moors and bizarre costumes,<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""\n>[15]</a\n>\n    an expedient through which Lippi illustrates the <i>Homilies</i> and Vasari\n    narrates them; turbans and camels, pearls and sandals in the painting have the\n    same value that the words \xd4<i>indiani</i>\xd5 and \xd4<i>Mori\xd5</i> have in the text.\n    [For an essay on the Magi in the context of the New World discoveries,\n    <a href="#strauss-magi">see the essay by Scarlett Strauss</a>.]\n</p>\n<p>\n    A similar concept is at work in the\n    <a\n            href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Andrea_del_Sarto_-_Triumph_of_Caesar_-_WGA00382.jpg"\n            target="_blank"\n    >Tribute to Caesar</a\n    >\n    (1520 ca.) a fresco by Andrea Del Sarto, in the Medicean Villa of Poggio a\n    Caiano.\n</p>\n<p>\n    In this picture Andrea, in order to surpass Franciabigio and Jacopo, subjected\n    himself to unexampled labour, drawing in it a magnificent perspective-view and\n    a very masterly flight of steps, which formed the ascent to the throne of\n    C\xbesar. And these steps he adorned with very well-designed statues, not being\n    content with having proved the beauty of his genius in the variety of figures\n    that are carrying on their backs all those different animals, such as the\n    figure of an Indian who is wearing a yellow coat, and carrying on his\n    shoulders a cage drawn in perspective with some parrots both within it and\n    without, the whole being rarely beautiful; and such, also, as some who are\n    leading Indian goats, lions, giraffes, panthers, lynxes, and apes, with Moors\n    and other lovely things of fancy, all grouped in a beautiful manner and\n    executed divinely well in fresco<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""\n>[16]</a\n>\n</p>\n<p>\n    The most important element in this passage is the \xd4<i>figura</i\n><i> indiana</i>\xd5. The choice of these words poses a problem: why is Vasari\n    referring to this figure as \xd4Indian\xd5? The man is seen from the back, his face\n    is not visible; apparently there is nothing that would explain this unusual\n    characterization. A closer observation, however, will offer some details that\n    could clarify the problem. The figure is wearing pants, traditionally\n    associated with an Oriental or Barbaric fashion (especially in an Ancient\n    Roman setting); the mention of the yellow cloak could provide another\n    explanation if we read it as a reference to the pigment <i>giallo</i\n><i> indiano</i>. All these reasons, however, seem feeble, especially if we\n    consider that the scene represents Caesar receiving a tribute from foreign\n    ambassadors, <a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a> therefore\n    justifying the presence of not one, but many, \xd2Indians.\xd3 The text could help\n    us understand: Vasari describes the figure focusing the attention on two\n    elements: the yellow cloak and the cage with parrots that he is carrying. (On\n    parrots, see the entry by <a href="#lipsman-parrots"> Claire Lipsman</a>.) The\n    cage is filled with numerous birds, most likely coming from different parts of\n    the globe, and is crowned by a magnificent, brightly colored specimen.\n    Although not depicted from life, the disposition and color of the feathers and\n    the form of the beak seem to suggest an identification with the Scarlet Macaw\n    (Ara Macao), native to the Amazon region. The inclusion of an unmistakably\n    American parrot reveals that Andrea Del Sarto deliberately chose to reference\n    the New World in this work in order to show that people from every corner of\n    the Earth, even from the most remote ones, came to pay tribute to Caesar, and\n    metaphorically to the Medici.\n    <a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a> The placement of the\n    figure on the extreme left of the fresco, just as the Americas were \xd2placed\xd3\n    on the extreme \xd2left\xd3 of Europe, seems to confirm this hypothesis. It is\n    important to note that Del Sarto\xd5s work on painting the scene does not extend\n    beyond the figure of Caesar; the right side of the fresco was completed in\n    1585 by Alessandro Allori. The later addition perhaps altered the balance of\n    the original composition, enclosed between two very well-defined extremes:\n    almost Columns of Hercules, the \xd4<i>figura</i><i> indiana</i>\xd5 and Caesar\n    serve as pillars; the New World on one side, open and unknown, and, on the\n    other side, the embodiment of Rome, the classical center of the world, ideally\n    replaced by Florence in the Renaissance. This symbolic system is perfectly\n    understood by Vasari, who participates in the iconographical game by calling\n    the figure \xd4Indian\xd5.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Other sixteenth century authors, such as Ariosto and Tasso, follow a similar\n    trend. The <i>Orlando Furioso </i>and the <i>Gerusalemme</i\n><i> Liberata</i> represent two more examples of the problem of awareness. In\n    canto 15 of the <i>Orlando</i>, in a tribute to Charles V and his global\n    empire, Ariosto elevates Cort\u017ds to immortal glory and, in an epic parallel,\n    Tasso uses his own canto 15 to honor Columbus as one of the most illustrious\n    men of his time. The grand encomia paid to the protagonists of the age of\n    exploration prove the interest of Italian intellectuals in the matters of the\n    New World, but the disjunction of historical events and linguistic tendencies\n    is evident in their use of the word \xd4<i>indiano</i><i>.</i>\xd5 Tasso\xd5s\n    narration, in particular, is set in an era which could have not been further\n    from the problem of India, and yet he celebrates Columbus, while referring to\n    Muslim generals and knights as \xd4<i>indiano</i>\xd5. The word here is a synonym of\n    infidel, but in the great praise paid to the courage of the \xd4<i>fero</i\n><i> indio\xd5 </i> Adrasto it is free of any negative connotation.\n    <a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[19]</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Along the same lines, sixteenth and seventeenth century inventories of\n    Venetian, Bolognese and Florentine collections confirm the\n    historical-philological incoherence and the persistence of the idea of\n    Amerasia in the Italian language. In the inventories of the Medici collection,\n    for instance, the terms \xd4<i>indiano</i>\xd5, \xd4<i>all\xd5indiana</i\n><i>\xd5, \xd4dell\xd5India\xd5 </i>were alternatively used to denote objects from\n    America, Asia, Africa, thus encompassing many things exotic or foreign. Mixtec\n    masks \xd4<i>all\xd5indiana</i>\xd5, feather robes \xd4<i>dell\xd5India</i>\xd5 were displayed\n    together with Asian artifacts in Cosimo\xd5s Guardaroba, the same one described\n    by Vasari as a representation of the whole world. The same happens in\n    Bolognese and Venetian collections, from the case of Ulisse Aldovrandi and his\n    indiscriminate use of Indian and American terms, to the mention of \xd4a lizard,\n    or another animal from America, the newly rediscovered part of the world\xd5used\n    in combination with \xd4<i>indiano</i><i>\xd5 </i>or \xd4<i>delle</i><i> Indie\xd5 </i>in\n    the <i>Inventario</i>of Andrea Mantova Benavides (1695).\n    <a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">[20]</a> (On the Florentine Codex\n    owned by Ferdinando I de Medici, see the entry by\n    <a href="#raitt-florentinecodex"> Louisa Raitt.</a>)\n</p>\n<p>\n    To observe the occurrence of this phenomenon in visual arts, we can turn to\n    Germany. Albrecht Altdorfer\xd5s <i>Christ Crowned with Thorns</i> (1518), part\n    of the <i>Saint Sebastian Altar, </i>is a parallel to Vasari\xd5s textual\n    fluidity in the realm of images. The background of the painting shows a\n    secondary scene,<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[21]</a>\n    characterized by the odd presence of a figure that can be easily identified as\n    an Amerindian, from the feather headdress to the partial nudity and the club\n    resting on his shoulder. The presence of this Indian, at first rather bizarre,\n    could be explained by the fact that the scene is set in the Holy Land, a place\n    east of Europe, and it represents episodes from the Passion of Christ. A\n    character native to the most remote place on Earth, possibly pagan and\n    infidel, could help us put a distance between our Christian Europe and the\n    barbarous actions perpetrated against Christ.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Altdorfer is also an interesting figure, since his case shares many\n    similarities with Vasari\xd5s. Both artists worked in an environment strongly\n    fascinated with the New World: in Florence, the Medici were collecting\n    American artefacts, just as was happening in Augsburg. The Florentine\n    infatuation with the Americas developed during the course of the sixteenth\n    century, taking the form of Ludovico Buti\xd5s frescoes in the Uffizi, or that of\n    the Thornton expedition in the seventeenth century. (On the Buti frescoes, see\n    the essay\n    <a href="#weitzman-armeria">Margo Weitzman.</a>) The Northern artists did not\n    remain indifferent: the interest of artists such as D\u0178rer and Burkmair (part\n    of the same circle of Altdorfer) is evident in their drawings and\n    illustrations, and the <i>Triumph of Maximilian I</i> (1518) could be\n    considered the final phase of the evolution of this interest. The\n    <a\n            href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/431769"\n            target="_blank"\n    >People of Calicut</a\n    >, part of the procession in honor of the Emperor in the <i>Triumphs,</i> are\n    the representation of this culture of exchanges, symbolizing at the same time\n    the notions of extremities and fusion in a propagandistic and celebratory\n    context.

Purg.VII.74 poses a series of\n        problems of interpretation. Scholars usually identify <i>indico </i>with\n        <i>indaco</i> (the blue pigment), but some propose that the words\n        <i>indico</i> and <i>legno</i> should be read together, therefore indicating\n        ebony (see Virgil, <i>Sola India nigrum fert hebanum</i>, Georg.II). Ebony\n        is a type of wood typical of Ethiopia, as well as Asian regions such as\n        Indochina and Sri Lanka. If we accept the second interpretation, this could\n        exemplify the persistence of an India-Ethiopia overlap in the languages of\n        12th century Italy.

The Reception and Interpretation of\n    Mesoamerican Manuscripts in Europe\n</h1>\n<h2>Michael Agnew</h2>\n<p>\n    Modern viewers of the map designed by Caspar Vopel and published by Giovanni\n    Andrea Vavassore in 1558, even when aware of contemporary representations of\n    Asia and America as a single landmass, are likely to be surprised by the close\n    contiguity of East Asian place names alongside Mesoamerican ones. In the\n    region of the map labelled Hispania Nova (New Spain), we find Temixtitan\n    (Tenochtitlan, Mexico City) due east of Mangi (Manzi, or Southern China) and\n    southeast of Chatay (Cathay, or Northern China), with a Messigo (Mexico) to\n    the west of Mangi and a smattering of cities ending in <i>fu</i> (a Chinese\n    administrative division signifying "prefecture") in the same general region as\n    identifiably Mesoamerican place names like Aculuacan (Acolhuacan), all within\n    the lands of Asia Magna (Greater Asia) and bordered on the east by what is now\n    known as the Gulf of Mexico but that here is labelled Mare Cathayum (Sea of\n    Cathay). Vopel\'s assertive amalgamation of newly discovered territories with\n    East Asian geography promotes the idea that Chinese lands fell well within the\n    territorial claims of the Spanish Crown, and not Portugal\'s. His explanatory\n    cartouches that identify Moctezuma, the ruler of Tenochtitlan, with the Great\n    Khan, reinforce this notion.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Regardless of Vopel\'s geopolitical thesis, it is worth considering whether his\n    contemporaries would find this imbrication of China and Mexico as jarring as\n    it is to us. How could these disparate regions and cultures be so closely\n    drawn together in his geographic imaginary that they effectively overlapped?\n    The European reception and understanding of one aspect of the pre-Columbian\n    cultures of the Valley of Mexico, their books and pictographic writing, can\n    help shed light on this apparent quandary.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Alexander Nagel has drawn attention to a volume now in the Biblioteca\n    Universitaria di Bologna that once belonged to Ferdinando Cospi, a\n    seventeenth-century collector who eventually donated his cabinet of\n    curiosities to the Bolognese senate in 1660.<a\n        href="#_edn2"\n        name="_ednref2"\n        title=""\n>[2]</a\n>\n    As Nagel notes, the preliminary inventory of Cospi\'s collection, prepared in\n    1667 by Lorenzo Legati, describes the manuscript as a "book from China with\n    various hieroglyphs," corresponding exactly to what originally appeared on the\n    cover of the (European) vellum binding, which at the time read "Libro della\n    China" [Fig. 1].<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img\n            width="100%"\n            src="agnew-images/agnew-fig1.jpg"\n            alt="Description: cover page of the Cospi Codex"\n    />\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Fig. 1.

(Photo: Alexander Nagel)\n</p>\n<p>\n    The first part of the original inscription was imperfectly erased and\n    corrected to read, "Book from <i>Mexico</i> given by the lord Count Valerio\n    Zani to the lord Marquis Cospi on December 26, 1665." Underneath the\n    palimpsest, however, one can still vaguely make out the original "Libro della\n    <i>China</i>" [Fig. 1].<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a> When\n    Legati prepared a detailed descriptive catalogue of the Cospi collection a\n    decade later in 1677, he rectified his characterization of the book, listing\n    it as a "Libro messicano."<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a>\n    Did this shift (on the book\'s cover and in the catalogue) reflect some\n    recognition that Legati\'s original description was erroneous? Or could\n    "Mexico" and "China" somehow have been entirely compatible terms, and this\n    change was simply an effort to describe it with greater precision, as if\n    "Mexico" were a part of a larger territory called "China" or perhaps adjacent\n    to it in an "Asia Magna"? It is difficult to say which. Legati is careful to\n    describe other books and documents from China in the collection as\n    "Chinese."<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> Presumably he\n    could have known from contemporary maps more accurate than Vopel\'s that Asia\n    and America were in fact not connected. Yet despite the watery divide of the\n    Pacific and the scrupulous cataloguer\'s plausible desire for precision, it is\n    nevertheless still possible that he and others who consulted the Codex Cospi\n    did not conceive of that division as impeding some fundamental cultural\n    connection between (our) East Asia and Mesoamerica.\n</p>\n<p>\n    In the second chapter of his account of language and knowledge in Europe\n    before the Age of Reason in <i>The Order of Things</i>, Michel Foucault\n    describes how the principle of resemblance subtended the interpretation of\n    texts and the world in their interpenetrating relationship. Specifically, he\n    defines four kinds of similitude: <i>convenientia</i>, a coming together\n    expressing the adjacency of things in the great chain of being;\n    <i>aemulatio</i>, or similarity between things that are not contiguous on that\n    chain; <i>analogia</i>, a kind of superimposition of <i>convenientia</i> and\n    <i>aemulatio</i>, which refers to analogous relationships between sets of\n    things; and, finally, <i>sympathia</i>, which (for example) governs the\n    movement of the four elements or the physiological humors and involves a\n    transformative displacement of qualities between disparate things in the\n    natural world (humors, elements, planets) that are connected at a distance\n    because of their supposed affinities.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""\n>[7]</a\n>\n</p>\n<p>\n    All of these categories involve, in one form or another, an epistemological\n    process of <i>assimilation</i>: ascribing similar qualities to otherwise\n    different things. Strikingly, though his sources postdate the Transatlantic\n    encounter between Europe and the Americas, Foucault does not explore the\n    implications of these historical events, which surely could have tested\n    European modes of thought founded on the principle of resemblances and\n    provided a basis for the epistemic shift towards a taxonomic order based on\n    the principle of difference that he situates in the Age of Reason. Foucault\n    misses an opportunity to examine the intellectual ramifications of European\n    exploration and colonization in Africa, Asia and the Americas, but his\n    omission is perhaps not entirely surprising, given the concerted efforts\n    European thinkers made during the two centuries after Columbus\'s voyages to\n    assimilate a "New World" into the preexisting hermeneutic schemas that had\n    developed as part of the complex architecture of late medieval and early\n    modern epistemologies.\n</p>\n<p>\n    One such instance of assimilation, tied to the domain of books and\n    writing&#8212;which, as Foucault points out, was privileged over orality in\n    early modern Europe&#8212;Is European interpretation of the pictographic\n    writing and illustrations in the few surviving examples of pre-Columbian\n    manuscripts and in post-conquest codices prepared under the watchful eye of\n    missionaries.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a> Their reception\n    in Europe reflects the primacy of the written word and encouraged the\n    incorporation of indigenous American writing systems within a larger narrative\n    of the Biblical "confusion of tongues" in the episode of the Tower of Babel,\n    with <i>written</i> words understood to be the underlying form of language,\n    and all writing, however far removed from its origins before Babel, darkly\n    mirroring the words in the "book of Creation." European attempts to understand\n    Mesoamerican manuscripts can be tied to two intellectual currents, both of\n    which emerged out of traditions of esotericism: on the one hand, the images\n    found in emblem books, and, on the other, inquiries into the history of human\n    languages. Both currents informed European scholars\' interest in Egyptian\n    hieroglyphs and other written manifestations of ancient languages; both are\n    tied to a fundamentally visual or scriptural conception of language as a\n    mysterious chain of resemblances linking words to things; both depend on\n    allegorical modes of thought according to which a single image can encompass a\n    complex statement.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Europeans who scrutinized Mesoamerican manuscripts understood their images and\n    pictographs to be analogous to Egyptian hieroglyphs, a comparison that Pietro\n    Martire d\'Anghiera makes in his fourth <i>Decade</i> (first published in 1521)\n    when discussing Mesoamerican books: "The characters are very different from\n    ours, laid out line-by-line as we do, with small blocks, hooks, loops, lines,\n    stars, and other shapes.

Though Pietro Martire does not use\n    the precise term <i>hieroglyphs</i>, what exactly that concept encompassed in\n    the early modern period deserves some unpacking, especially because Legati\n    seems to have interpreted not just the pictographs proper in the Codex Cospi\n    as hieroglyphs but also what are in fact illustrations depicting deities and\n    rulers. The word emerged in the context of the discovery in 1419 of a treatise\n    from late antiquity on Egyptian symbolic writing, the\n    <i>Hieroglyphica</i> attributed to a certain Horapollo (a Hellenized compound\n    of Horus Apollo), which circulated among Italian humanists. Early modern\n    fascination with Egyptian monumental inscriptions was further encouraged by\n    the contemporary excavation in Rome of sculptures and obelisks bearing\n    hieroglyphics.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Although Horapollo\'s <i>Hieroglyphica</i> was no Rosetta Stone, and Europeans\n    remained fundamentally in the dark regarding Egyptian writing until 1799,\n    speculation about the meaning of Egyptian inscriptions prompted Europeans\n    themselves to create inventive "hieroglyphs" of the sort that appear in\n    Francesco Colonna\'s <i>Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</i> (Venice, 1499). Most\n    famous among them perhaps is the emblem that its printer, Aldus Manutius,\n    later adopted as his own device and motto, the dolphin-entwined anchor\n    signifying <i>festina tarde</i> (or <i>lente</i>, "hasten slowly"), paired in\n    the illustration in Colonna\'s book with another emblem: a helmet, an ox-skull,\n    and an oil lamp representing the idea that Patience is the ornament, guardian\n    and protector of life [Fig. 2].\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img\n            width="100%"\n            src="agnew-images/agnew-fig2.jpg"\n            alt="Description: facsimile of Poliphili Hypnerotomachia"\n    />\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Fig. 2.

Each\n    emblem, furthermore, is accompanied by elaborate exegeses suggesting that, in\n    accordance with the contemporary understanding of Egyptian hieroglyphs, the\n    images could function as shorthand for entire complexes of ideas.\n</p>\n<p>\n    In this light, Lorenzo Legati\'s attempt to understand the images and\n    pictographs in the Codex Cospi&#8212;if not their semantic content, at least\n    their function&#8212;becomes clearer. His description of the manuscript,\n    following an account of its size and accordion-book format ("it is not divided\n    into leaves, like our books"), indicates that the book contains "only\n    HIEROGLYPHS from MEXICO"&#8212;Legati\'s uppercase&#8212;"which are very\n    extravagant figures that for the most part portray strangely monstrous humans\n    and animals" [Fig. 6].<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img\n            width="100%"\n            src="agnew-images/agnew-fig6.jpg"\n            alt="Description: legati museo cospiano 191"\n    />\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Fig. 6.

Original from The Getty Research\n    Institute.\n</p>\n<p>\n    These he divides into various categories, by size: "massimi," "mediocri,"\n    "menori," and "minimi." The penultimate class, "lesser" figures, are arranged\n    in "marginal compartments, as if they were (and perhaps they are) marginal\n    notes or commentary on the larger hieroglyphs," and the last group, the\n    smallest, "likewise seem to explain the largest hieroglyphs, which they\n    surround like a crown."<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a>\n    Though Legati identifies no analogous format for the manuscript (like an Asian\n    accordion book), he does intuit an analogy for the small pictographs around\n    the margins ("marginal notes or commentary") and situates the pictographs and\n    illustrations in the general category of hieroglyphs, presumably basing his\n    assessment on an Egyptian model&#8212;or, rather, on a model that encompassed\n    also the elaborate allegories in emblem books, conflating those figures with\n    Egyptian hieroglyphs as they were understood by European savants. The examples\n    he provides include an image of the Lord of the House of Dawn,\n    Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli (the planet Venus), and a throne, both\n    <i>geroglifici massimi</i> in Legati\'s classification. The woodcut\n    reproduction in Legati\'s catalogue, however, misrepresents what in the\n    original manuscript is a narrative scene in which a fearsome god attacks the\n    throne with his spear. In the catalogue, the figure has been reversed and does\n    not interact with the throne, suggesting that Legati interpreted each element\n    as a separate "hieroglyph" [Fig. 7; cf. Fig. 8] .\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img\n            width="100%"\n            src="agnew-images/agnew-fig7.jpg"\n            alt="Description: legati museo cospiano 192"\n    />\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Fig. 7.

This section also includes various\n    books and ink drawings from China, which immediately precede the erstwhile\n    "Chinese" book, now catalogued as "Mexican." Legati refers to Chinese\n    characters as such (<i>caratteri</i>) and not as hieroglyphs. Nevertheless, he\n    cites at length the humanist and historiographer Cosimo Bartoli\n    (1503&#8211;1572), who, after explaining that each character represents a word\n    and that they would be better ddescribed as ciphers <i>(cifere)</i>, explicitly\n    compares Chinese characters to Egyptian writing: they are "ingenious work,\n    perhaps even more witty than Egyptian hieroglyphs."<a\n        href="#_edn13"\n        name="_ednref13"\n        title=""\n>[13]</a\n>\n    Legati notes that the Chinese write with a brush, something he also draws our\n    attention to in the description of the Mexican book, which contains "works not\n    of the pen but of the brush."<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""\n>[14]</a\n>\n</p>\n<p>\n    We lack even an approximate date for the creation of the Codex Cospi, but the\n    style of the images and pictographs as well as the book\'s folded format\n    reflect a decidedly pre-Columbian tradition, even if it was in fact prepared\n    during the early years of the conquest of Mexico.<a\n        href="#_edn15"\n        name="_ednref15"\n        title=""\n>[15]</a\n>\n    Following the conquest, missionaries working in the Spanish colonies oversaw\n    the production of newfangled books by indigenous informants, scribes, and\n    painters: European-style codices proper, with hinges at the spine, whose\n    imagery reflected the influence of European draftsmanship while conserving\n    fundamental aspects of Mesoamerican pictographic conventions. (link to <a href="#raitt-florentinecodex">Raitt\n    essay</a> on the Florentine Codex). One such document is the so-called Codex\n    Mendoza, perhaps commissioned by the first viceroy of New Spain, Antonio de\n    Mendoza and probably prepared during his administration (1535&#8211;1550). The\n    book presents a pictorial history of the founding of Tenochtitlan and the\n    reign of its first ruler, followed by an accounting of the tributes paid to\n    the Mexica rulers of that city by conquered territories [Fig. 9].\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img\n            width="100%"\n            src="agnew-images/agnew-fig9.jpg"\n            alt="Description: codex mendoza"\n    />\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Fig. 9. <i>Codex Mendoza</i>, fol. 2r.

From\n    <i>Athanasius Kircher at Stanford</i>.\n</p>\n<p>\n    This work was the culmination of Kircher\'s studies in ancient languages,\n    presenting a fanciful and quasi-mystical interpretation of Egyptian\n    hieroglyphics and a reaffirmation of his thesis that Egyptian writing (and\n    wisdom and religion) provided the ancient foundations for that of the Indians,\n    the East Asians, and even the Americans, however distorted and debased (in\n    Kircher\'s understanding) that original writing and wisdom had become through\n    the process of its dissemination in Antiquity. Or, as he put it in the work\n    where he first formulated the thesis extensively, his\n    <i>Prodromus Coptus sive Aegyptiacus</i> (Coptic or Egyptian Precursor,\n    published in Rome in 1636), "Egypt was the nursery not only of the progress of\n    the Christian religion in distant lands, but also of all the superstitions\n    propagated to the world at every time."<a\n        href="#_edn18"\n        name="_ednref18"\n        title=""\n>[18]</a\n>\n    For Kircher, in spreading the gospel of Christ throughout the world, the\n    Apostles had simply followed the same routes taken by the priests of ancient\n    Egypt in propagating their wisdom and writing to the rest of humanity beyond\n    Europe. (link to <a href="#walsh-thomas">Walsh essay on St. Thomas</a>) Kircher\'s vision of language,\n    history, and theology entails some fundamental affinity or similarity spanning\n    a vast swath of lands and peoples, from North Africa, across Asia, and into\n    the Americas: "India" writ large, in other words, from Vopel\'s "India Maior\n    Aethiopiae" (Greater India of Ethiopia) in Africa, through his "India intra\n    Gangem" (India before the Ganges) and "India extra Gangem" (India beyond the\n    Ganges), all the way to the "India Orientalis" in "Asia Magna" (his Greater\n    Asia, a label that appears in our North America) and the lands of the Mexica.\n    Even though maps included in Kircher\'s publications depict a wide Pacific\n    Ocean (or <i>Mare Australe</i>) and a strait between eastern Siberia and\n    Alaska, conceptually at least these territories were contiguous.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Thus, while Mexican temples might lend themselves to easy comparison with\n    Egyptian pyramids, as Kircher explicitly does in his discussion of the temple\n    of Huitzilopochtli in the chapter of <i>Oedipus Aegyptiacus</i> titled "On the\n    religion of the Americans, a parallel of the Egyptian" ("De religione\n    Americanorum Aegyptiacae parallela") [Fig. 12], Asian pagodas do not.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img\n            width="100%"\n            src="agnew-images/agnew-fig12.jpg"\n            alt="Description: Kircher Horcholivos 422"\n    />\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Fig. 12.

In the\n    series of encomia to Ferdinand III of Austria composed in dozens of different\n    languages and scripts at the beginning of <i>Oedipus Aegyptiacus</i>, Kircher\n    includes one purporting to be in Brahmi script, which he calls "hieroglyphic\n    language of the Brahmans" ("lingua hieroglyphica Brachmanum"). And the origin\n    of Chinese "hieroglyphic" characters ("characteres hieroglyphici Sinensium")\n    is likewise Egyptian according to his <i>China illustrata</i>: "The ancient\n    Chinese followed the Egyptians, from whom they are descended: they executed\n    their writing not by a composition of letters but by figures constructed from\n    various natural things," such as the characters he claims are derived from\n    images of birds [Fig. 14].<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[21]</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img\n            width="100%"\n            src="agnew-images/agnew-fig14.jpg"\n            alt="Description: kircher chinese characters"\n    />\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Fig. 14.

Original from\n    The Getty Research Institute.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Kircher states his overarching thesis regarding the cultural genealogy of the\n    peoples of the world who use non-alphabetic writing systems, or\n    <i>characteres significativi</i>, at the beginning of this same section of\n    <i>China illustrata</i>, titled "On Chinese Literature" (<i>De Sinensium\n    literatura</i>): "it is certain that three nations, before all other peoples of\n    the world, made use of these [characters], namely, the Chinese, the Brahmans,\n    and the Mexicans."<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[22]</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    However much the accuracy of seventeenth-century maps had improved over\n    Vopel\'s vision of the world, Kircher\'s works suggest that, in certain corners\n    at least, the underlying principles behind Vopel\'s organization of geography\n    remained in force. Asia and America might well have become clearly delineated\n    continents, but they were part of a world in which the dream of recovering a\n    universal, Adamic language&#8212;one that preserved a direct correspondence\n    between words and things&#8212;was still conceivable, for its traces were\n    retrievable in the visual echoes of the scripts of ancient and modern\n    languages.

Sahag\xfan travelled to central Mexico in 1529, just eight years\n  after Cort\xe9s\' conquest of Tenochtitlan. As a missionary, he learned Nahuatl,\n  enabling him to translate the psalms and the gospels for local populations.\n  Sahag\xfan\'s most notable accomplishment, however, was his assembling of this\n  encyclopedic codex. However, the codex cannot be merely considered a work of\n  Sahag\xfan alone, for it was truly a verbal and visual documentation of Mexican\n  civilization from an indigenous point of view.

The images, too, present a\n  fusion of cultures. The Nahua <i>tlacuilos</i> who worked with Sahag\xfan took\n  great care to depict themselves in a way that retained the authenticity of\n  their cultural traditions so that their culture could be preserved; at the\n  same time, they depicted their culture in a European style in order to make it\n  accessible and interesting to European audiences. In this way, the\n  <i>tlacuilos</i> were active creators, Europeanizing their way of seeing while\n  remaining faithful to ancient canons.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""\n    >[4]</a\n  >\n  Serge Gruzinski called it an "unprecedented experiment," wherein the\n  "Renaissance arts of sculpture, architecture and painting entered into a\n  dialogue with traditions that had been cultivated by pre-Columbian\n  civilizations for millennia."<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a>\n  How was this fascinating encyclopedic text received?

While they understood that the codex contained images of the\n  Indians from the territory recently conquered by Cort\xe9s and in turn made\n  available to mendicants, they were unable to comprehend how the book fit into\n  a larger picture of world cultures. In simple terms, the codex offered its\n  readers an abundance of information about this complex civilization and its\n  images, while leaving open the question of what and where exactly the Indies\n  were.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The codex used a great variety of representations of dress and costume to\n  visualize Aztec conceptions of class, rank, and profession, as well as to\n  distinguish between gods, mortals, and <i>ixiptla</i> (incarnated images).<a\n    href="#_edn12"\n    name="_ednref12"\n    title=""\n    >[12]</a\n  >\n  Mapping such differences allowed indigenous artists to showcase the\n  heterogeneity of the Aztec people.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""\n    >[13]</a\n  >\n  While the European reception of these images was always beyond their control,\n  as we shall see, these stylized figures perhaps inadvertently encouraged\n  Europeans to understand the Indies as lands where America and Asia overlapped.\n  (On the range of meanings of the word India and Indians, see the entry by\n  <a href="#riccio-indians">Vittoria Riccio</a>.)

While the Nahua may have hoped to use\n  these images to represent and preserve the complexity of Aztec culture, this\n  array of skin tones would have likely registered as an "ethnographic map" for\n  a European audience, a map that worked to categorize the people of the Indies\n  by different types rather than to underscore the nuanced variety of this\n  civilization.<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a> While race\n  was not an established social construct in the sixteenth century, many\n  proto-ethnographic accounts from the far reaches of the world written during\n  this period took special note of skin color, catering to an audience keenly\n  attuned to nuances in pigment and physiognomy.<a\n    href="#_edn15"\n    name="_ednref15"\n    title=""\n    >[15]</a\n  >\n  Seeing these diverse exotic figures in the pages of the codex could easily\n  have suggested to European readers that these people inhabited a part of the\n  world with a diversity of climates and cultures: the Indies, or as an\n  extension of India.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The codex\'s emphasis on diversity and its suggestion of the significant\n  geographic range of Aztec peoples stands in stark contrast to the flattened\n  portrayal of the Amerindian in the illustrations of the <i>Trachtenbuch</i> of\n  Christoph Weiditz from some decades earlier (Fig. 2).\n</p>\n<p>\n  <img\n    width="100%"\n    src="raitt-images/raitt-fig2a.jpg"\n    alt="Description: Trachtenbuch page 12-13"\n  />\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  <img\n    width="100%"\n    src="raitt-images/raitt-fig2b.jpg"\n    alt="Description: Trachtenbuch page 6-7"\n  />\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  <img\n    width="100%"\n    src="raitt-images/raitt-fig2c.jpg"\n    alt="Description: Trachtenbuch page 2-3"\n  />\n</p>\n<p>\n  Fig. 2: Christoph Weiditz (German), <i>Trachtenbuch</i>, Germanische\n  Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg, Hs. 22474.4.

Drawing our attention to the thirteen\n  paintings of Amerindians in the <i>Trachtenbuch, </i>Elizabeth Boone points\n  out that it was difficult "for Europeans then&#8212;and even for scholars\n  until recently&#8212;to recognize real ethnic, cultural, and, indeed, social\n  distinctions among the indigenous people of the Americas." By contrast, "how\n  easy it was simply to blend them together as exotics."\n  <a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[16]</a> As the glosses of the\n  <i>Trachtenbuch</i> suggest, the Indies were simply distant lands. Therefore,\n  the intent of Nahua artists to depict the Aztecs as a complex and\n  heterogeneous culture was likely lost on European audiences; what stuck,\n  perhaps, was more the vibrancy and exoticism that worked to confirm European\n  perceptions of Indianness.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The presence and absence of clothing also played an important role in\n  Europeans\' understanding of the Indians. European chroniclers typically\n  portrayed the conquest of the Aztecs through scenes of armored Spanish\n  soldiers defeating a population of naked or nearly naked indigenous figures.\n  The art historian Karel Van Mander, for instance, describes such a scene\n  painted by the Dutch artist Jan Mostaert as "a landscape, a West Indian one,\n  with many naked people." (Fig. 3)\n  <a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n  <img\n    width="100%"\n    src="raitt-images/raitt-fig3.jpg"\n    alt="Description:landscape with conquest of america"\n  />\n</p>\n<p>\n  Fig. 3: Jan Mostaert (Dutch),\n  <i>Landscape with an Episode from the Conquest of America,</i> ca. 1535.\n  Rijksmuseum.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Their nakedness, along with their primitive technology and contrasting skin\n  tone were meant to register both a geospatial and temporal distance. And yet,\n  this is not how other types of Indians are portrayed. Images of other\n  civilizations that made up the Indies, what we would call Asia for example,\n  did not often employ depictions of indigenous peoples as naked or\n  near-naked.<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a> In fact, when\n  members of Ferdinando de Medici\'s court saw Jacopo Zucchi\'s\n  <i>Allegory of the Americas</i> (Fig. 4), they understood the figures in the\n  foreground to be "beautiful Roman women" that were disguised as "New World\n  Natives."<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[19]</a> Perhaps his\n  remarks indicate that nudity had come to be synonymous with the Americas,\n  while diverse clothing signaled something else entirely.<a\n    href="#_edn20"\n    name="_ednref20"\n    title=""\n    >[20]</a\n  >\n</p>\n<p>\n  <img\n    width="100%"\n    src="raitt-images/raitt-fig4.jpg"\n    alt="Description: Zucchi Allegory of Discovery of America or Coral Fishers"\n  />\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Fig. 4: Jacopo Zucchi (Italian), <i>Allegory of the Americas, </i>ca. 1590.\n  Lviv National Art Gallery.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A related trope, the allegories of the continents, which became increasingly\n  popular in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, reveals a similar tension\n  between nude and clothed figures. America (along with Africa) is nearly always\n  personified as a naked figure, adorned with beautiful jewels but left\n  unclothed and vulnerable. The personification of Asia, on the other hand, is\n  dressed in fine garments; while still foreign and exotic, it was usually\n  associated with Europe through clothing.<a\n    href="#_edn21"\n    name="_ednref21"\n    title=""\n    >[21]</a\n  >\n</p>\n<p>\n  <img\n    width="100%"\n    src="raitt-images/raitt-fig5.jpg"\n    alt="Description: Collaert America"\n  />\n  <img\n    width="100%"\n    src="raitt-images/raitt-fig6.jpg"\n    alt="Description: Collaert Asia"\n  />\n  <img\n    width="100%"\n    src="raitt-images/raitt-fig7.jpg"\n    alt="Description: Collaert Europa"\n  />\n  <img\n    width="100%"\n    src="raitt-images/raitt-fig8.jpg"\n    alt="Description: Collaert Africa"\n  />\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Figs. 5-8: Adriaen Collaert (Netherlandish), <i>The Four Continents, </i>n.d.\n  Engravings.

Fig. 8: Africa\n</p>\n<p>\n  A sixteenth century engraved series personifying the continents by Adriaen\n  Collaert (Figs. 5-8) portrays America (Fig. 5) as a woman, scantily clad with\n  a swatch of drapery gently covering her lap, leaving her torso entirely\n  exposed. Her curly hair is tucked under a feather-plumed headdress and she\n  grasps a bow and arrow. Alternatively, his personification of Asia (Fig. 6)\n  wears sandals and a complicated costume, resembling the armored dress and\n  robes of a militant saint or angel in the Christian tradition. She swings an\n  incense burner and dons a headdress, which billows in the wind behind her.\n  Furthermore, even if her eyes do not meet ours, Asia is facing forward toward\n  the viewer, much like Europa (Fig. 7); America, on the other hand, looks back\n  behind her shoulder into the distance beyond, where the Amerindians suffer\n  losses in battle against invading European forces.\n</p>\n<p>\n  European allegories of Asia reinforce Marco Polo\'s representations of Cathay,\n  and of Asia as a prosperous ancient civilization. Even Francis Xavier, upon\n  his arrival to Japan in the mid-sixteenth century, remarked that the\n  inhabitants were pale skinned like Europeans; for Xavier, this must have been\n  because Japan shares the same latitude as Italy, for "the climate of Japan\n  resembles that of Italy, and the natives are [also] much like the Italians in\n  height."<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[22]</a> Since the time of\n  Marco Polo, Europeans saw civility and wealth in the Orient; knowing this, we\n  can imagine that the wide array of intricate garments depicted on the pages of\n  the Florentine Codex could have easily registered as Asian for learned\n  European audiences.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Details in the artist portraits in book nine have similar implications (Fig.\n  9).\n</p>\n<p>\n  <img\n    width="100%"\n    src="raitt-images/raitt-fig9a.jpg"\n    alt="Description: featherworking folio 65 verso"\n  />\n  <img\n    width="100%"\n    src="raitt-images/raitt-fig9b.jpg"\n    alt="Description: featherworking folio 66 recto"\n  />\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Fig. 9: Fray Bernardino de Sahag\u0153n and Nahua artists, The Art of the Amanteca\n  (feather artists), the Florentine Codex, ca. 1555-1577. Florence, Biblioteca\n  Medicea Laurenziana, Mediceo Palatino 219 Book IX, chapter 21, fol. 65v and\n  66r.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Here, both text and image represent the production of a variety of Aztec\n  crafts, including work in charcoal, clay, glue, gold, gems, and feathers. The\n  portraits of the artists serve several functions in the text. Firstly, they\n  highlight the artists\' embrace of European artistic techniques learned in\n  their training in the newly established Franciscan schools. The painter is\n  attentive to situate the <i>amantecas</i>, or Aztec featherworkers for\n  example, in a typical Renaissance architectural setting, incorporating\n  doorways flanked by columns, corbelled archways, receding tile floors,\n  background landscapes, and even adjusting the positioning of the figures all\n  to reveal the use of linear perspective, a technique not used prior to Spanish\n  conquest. Indigenous artists clearly used the codex to flaunt their quick\n  mastery of European techniques, but in a way that translated traditional\n  artistic practices into a format legible to European audiences. Secondly, each\n  vignette is different in its architectural details and setting. The diversity\n  of wardrobe and skin color emphasized in book one extends here to a variety of\n  physical differences among the individuals depicted. As Magaloni Kerpel has\n  shown, the Nahua painted these artists as careful portraits; no two faces are\n  the same.<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[23]</a> These portraits\n  thus represent both the desire of the Nahua to display their individuality and\n  diversity in a style that would resonate with European readers.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And yet, this clothing is far from Amerindian. While the <i>amantecas</i> work\n  on feather crafts, for instance, they wear draped grey tunics and resemble\n  portraits of medieval clerical artists more than Amerindians from the\n  <i>Trachtenbuch. </i>These garments would be familiar to a late\n  sixteenth-century European eye; and yet, when worn by new world peoples, the\n  viewer is asked to consider the sophistication of the civilization from which\n  these Indians and their objects hail. If they dress like us, and look like\n  us&#8212;or as allegorical images suggest, if they wear clothing, as did\n  Europeans and Asians &#8212;then they too could be like the natives of the\n  marvelous and sophisticated lands of the East.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A heightened attention to individuality and difference, the contextualization\n  of Aztec culture in Renaissance settings, the application of European artistic\n  techniques, and the portrayal of these artists in professional European\n  costume all worked to unsettle images of the Amerindian and detached the Nahua\n  from any particular place and time. Instead, these images left room for the\n  European viewer to envisage these figures occupying a multitude of different\n  lands in the Indies. Indeed, Ferdinando de Medici acquired the codex not\n  because it offered insight into a particular history of a particular\n  civilization, but rather because he saw it as "a valuable \'rarity\', adding\n  this work of art to his own [growing] collection of [other] exotica in\n  Florence."<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title="">[24]</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n  Perhaps the diverse array of figures displayed in the Florentine Codex\n  represented a kind of contact zone, or a "zone of convergence where East and\n  West met and crossed over into one another."<a\n    href="#_edn25"\n    name="_ednref25"\n    title=""\n    >[25]</a\n  >\n  Furthermore, it signified an ambiguous place where the barbarous New World\n  filled with luxurious gems, feathers, gold and silver, and nude savage figures\n  fell into and mixed with the opulent known richness of the east, the luxury\n  goods &#8211; the gold, the porcelain, and the silks &#8211; that had already\n  come to European courts from the East. To be clear, much of this discussion\n  remains speculative; we have no direct testimony on the part of Europeans\n  declaring how, exactly, they understood the images in Sahag\xfan\'s compilation,\n  or to what other representations they may have likened them. Nevertheless,\n  clearly, there was clearly potential for European readers to identify the\n  figures in the codex as Indian, broadly cast, or as Asian.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Vopel\'s map echoes this ambiguity. "Temixtitan" (another spelling of\n  Tenochtitlan) appears in capital letters just to the south of the cartographic\n  sign for the city, a castle with four spires cast out in the middle of a lake,\n  and Vopel places the Nahua just to the northeast.<a\n    href="#_edn26"\n    name="_ednref26"\n    title=""\n    >[26]</a\n  >\n  Nearby "Atacuba" (Tacuba) marks the site of the pre-Hispanic Nahua city of\n  Tlacopan, meaning "place of the jarilla plant". Just to the northwest of\n  "Nautal" on the map is "Leztalap" which could be a poor transliteration of the\n  Ancient Aztec city of Iztapalapa. Further north lies the city of \'Gualncingo\'\n  (Tulancingo), the place from which Prince Ixtlilxochitl gathered an army here\n  to join Hern\xe1n Cort\xe9s to conquer Tenochtitlan in 1521. All of these places in\n  the valley of Mexico are just northwest of Tampin, a city in Malaysia that\n  lies on the border of Malacca and just south of Singur, a known city on the\n  Indian subcontinent. In effect, Vopel\'s map suggests that the Florentine\n  Codex, made in Tlatelolco, was produced in the lands where East and West\n  overlapped.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In these ways, the Florentine Codex was an open text, capable of being\n  mobilized within a European worldview that was itself also under development.\n  A later sixteenth-century edition of the Florentine Codex that has recently\n  been discovered at the Hispanic Society of America in New York, with text\n  translated into Italian and the cover bearing Cardinal Ferdinando\'s coat of\n  arms, also highlights the codex\'s flexible, Amerasian nature.<a\n    href="#_edn27"\n    name="_ednref27"\n    title=""\n    >[27]</a\n  >\n  This copy, likely made in the 1580s, lacks images, but "has spaces intended\n  for images... [which] correspond precisely to the location of the images in\n  the Florentine Codex."<a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title="">[28]</a> It\n  proves Ferdinando\'s contemporary fascination with the codex and continues to\n  captivate our imagination now. Could we have better understood the way in\n  which the codex was received if Ferdinando\'s artists had finished their\n  version, copying and perhaps refashioning not only the text but the images as\n  well? What would these new world images have become in the hands of European\n  artists? And more precisely, what version of Indianness would these artists\n  have expressed?\n</p>\n\n<div id="edn1">\n  <p class="MsoEndnoteText">\n    <a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[1]</a> Bernardino de Sahag\u0153n and\n    Nahua artists,\n    <i>The General History of the Things of New Spain/ The Florentine Codex.</i>\n    ca.1555-77.

The concept of Ethiopia and Ethiopians was\n    multiple and expansive in the minds of Europeans from earliest antiquity. In\n    the opening lines of the <em>Odyssey</em>, Homer speaks of the Ethiopians who\n    inhabited both the westernmost and the easternmost parts of the world.\n    Ethiopia, sometimes metonymically standing in for all of Africa, had since\n    antiquity often been confused or associated with India.<a\n        href="#_edn1"\n        name="_ednref1"\n>[1]</a\n>\n    On medieval <em>mappaemundi</em>, the Indian Ocean is often minimized and\n    Ethiopia and India are pressed one against the other, treated as adjoining\n    regions. In the late Middle Ages, the widely read travels of John of Mandeville\n    recorded that the Nile flowed out of Earthly Paradise and through the deserts\n    of India before running underground and coming up near Ethiopia, again\n    connecting Africa to Asia.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a> On the\n    Vopel map, a little south of Aethiopia Media, we see a region called \u201cGreater\n    India of Ethiopia\u201d (<em>India maior Aethiopiae</em>), where the inhabitants\n    are Christian and speak <em>linguam Chaldaicam</em>, or Aramaic, and in this\n    region Vopel places the legendary ancient Christian king Prester John, who was\n    alternately located in both Ethiopia and India (see <a href="#pivar-presterjohn">Pivar essay on\n    Prester John</a>). When in August of 1441 missions of the Patriarch of Alexandria\n    in Egypt came to Florence from the Ethiopian Convent of Jerusalem, these\n    people were considered \u201cIndians from Greater India sent by Prester John.\u201d<a\n        href="#_edn3"\n        name="_ednref3"\n>[3]</a\n>\n    It seems clear that Vopel is adopting some such understanding of an Indian\n    Ethiopia.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Although often associated with northeastern Africa, the toponym Ethiopia and\n    the designation Ethiopian, deriving from the words \u201cburnt face\u201d or of dark\n    complexion, often stood for all Africa and Africans. Accordingly, on the Vopel\n    map we see the toponym throughout Africa, such as\n    <em>Aethiopia Inferior</em> (lower Africa) to the West and\n    <em>Aethiopia interior seu maior</em> (interior or greater Africa) in the\n    center of the continent near the equator. Towards the south is Agisymba, a\n    region deep in Africa mentioned by Ptolemy and said by him to contain large\n    animals, such as elephants and rhinoceros (we see an elephant not far away);\n    here it is labeled <em>Agisymba regio magna Aethiopum</em>, or greater\n    Agisymba region of the Ethiopians.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Given the wide applicability and Indian associations of the idea of Ethiopia,\n    it is not surprising to find in the post-Columbus period that Africa enters\n    into the Amerasian formation in numerous ways.

As he described it, on two nearby islands, \u201cthe men do not\n    live with their wives or with any other women; but all the women live on the\n    other island, which is called Female Island.

Columbus was the first to suggest that\n    Amazons inhabited the Americas. Recounting his first voyage in his 1493 Letter\n    to Sant\xe1ngel, Columbus built on Polo\u2019s account and reported on the absence of\n    men on the island of Matinino (Martinique). Here, \u201cwomen do not follow\n    feminine occupations but use cane bows and arrows like those of men and arm\n    and protect themselves with plates of copper, of which they have much.\u201d<a\n        href="#_edn4"\n        name="_ednref4"\n>[4]</a\n>\n    Columbus\u2019 Amazonian resonance determined the Amerasian placement of these\n    women for many years after his voyages; his description was enough to launch a\n    decades-long search for Amazons in the Americas.

Even after America was recognized as a separate\n    continent, the Amazonian associations continued to imbue American identity\n    generally. The Amazon figure became virtually emblematic of America in many\n    allegorical images of the continents, including Adriaen Collaert\u2019s engraving\n    of 1588-89 based on a design by Maerten de Vos, where the continent is\n    represented by an Amazon-like woman wearing an elaborate feathered military\n    helmet and wielding a battle axe and a bow and arrow.

In this sense, the Vopel map follows the 1507 map\n    by Martin Waldseem\xfcller, which named the newly discovered southern landmass\n    America after the explorer Amerigo Vespucci. After Vespucci and Waldseem\xfcller,\n    this southern territory was often labeled Mundus Novus (as we see, for\n    example, in the Ruysch map of 1507 and the roughly contemporary Hunt Lenox\n    Globe) or Novus Orbis (as we see for example in Sebastian M\xfcnster\u2019s 1540 map\n    of the \u201cnew Islands,\u201d <em>Novae Insulae</em>). If the territory north of this\n    southern landmass was understood by many, well into the seventeenth century,\n    to extend into Asia, agreement formed early on that this southern landmass was\n    a distinctly new addition to the world known since Antiquity. In keeping with\n    the Spanish orientation governing the map as a whole, Vopel ascribes the\n    discovery of this territory to Columbus, in 1497 (when he landed at the mouth\n    of the Orinoco river on his third voyage), and clearly states that Columbus\u2019\n    voyage was undertaken at the behest of the Spanish kings.\n</p>\n"},function(e,n){e.exports='<h1>Archipelagus</h1>\n\n<p>\n    To the west of his Amerasian continent, Vopel shows a South Sea (<em\n>Mare de Sur</em\n>) teeming with islands. When Vasco Nu\xf1ez de Balboa reached Darien \u2013 the\n    region located between the current day Panama and Columbia \u2013 he heard stories\n    from the natives about the rich kingdom to the South of the Isthmus \u201cbordering\n    upon a limitless sea.\u201d Since it was believed in the sixteenth century that the\n    Isthmus \u2013 current day southern Central America \u2013 runs from east to west,\n    Balboa might have assumed that he had got a step closer to the East and the\n    <em>multitudo insularum</em>, the many islands in the sea east of Asia, of\n    which Marco Polo had counted 12,700.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a>\n    Balboa called this sea \u201cthe South Sea\u201d and proclaimed it as Spanish territory.\n    Later when he came back to Spain, this sea was bestowed with a fixed name of\n    the <em>Tierra Nueva a la parte del mar del Sur</em> \u2013 in short, \u201cthe South\n    Sea\u201d \u2013 in 1514. The historian Dora Polk intertwines this moment of Balboa\u2019s\n    discovery of the South Sea with the Castilians\u2019 rivalry ambition with the\n    Portuguese; according to her, \u201cBalboa thought he was gazing [at] the Oceanus\n    Meridies or Meridionales,\u201d which was sailed by the Portuguese on their way to\n    the South Indies Sea; the ocean that was covered with islands \u201cfull of the\n    riche spice and jewel-laden islands of the east described by medieval\n    travelers.\u201d<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a> In this regard, the\n    historian Ricardo Padr\xf3n writes that Balboa\u2019s discovery was nothing\n    \u201cpreviously unknown, an unimagined ocean,\u201d but pointed \u201cthe easternmost shores\n    of something already known.\u201d<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Ideas about islands, and the islands of southeast Asia in particular, were\n    crucial to the formation and development of Amerasian mentalities. In his\n    <em>Geography</em>, Ptolemy established many aspects of Southeast Asian\n    geography and culture that would shape Western thought for many generations.\n    For Ptolemy, this part of the world was abundant in gold and spices, famously\n    inhabited by lions, tigers, elephants, parrots, men with tails, and cannibals\n    that Ptolemy called <em>manioli</em>, and above all, was a vast region of\n    islands.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a> Medieval writers ran with\n    this idea; Mandeville counted over 5,000 islands in this part of the world,\n    and Polo estimated there were 13,000 islands in the Sea of India and over\n    7,000 in the sea surrounding Japan.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a> On\n    the Behaim globe, a galaxy of islands populates the sea to the east of the\n    Asian landmass. In medieval European literary culture, islands emerged as a\n    site of the fantastical, mysterious, and marvelous.<a\n        href="#_edn6"\n        name="_ednref6"\n>[6]</a\n>\n</p>\n<p>\n    When Columbus voyaged to the western Atlantic, he therefore assumed a\n    connected relationship between the islands of the Caribbean and the fabled\n    islands of the East; he naturally imagined he had landed on islands off the\n    coast of Asia. In the wake of his journey, Europeans quickly and easily\n    understood Columbus\u2019s islands not as a dramatic new discovery, but as an\n    extension of an Asian geography that they had long been familiar with.\n    Columbus\u2019s islands, like the islands of Polo and Mandeville, were all Indies.\n</p>\n<p>\n    For this reason, sixteenth-century European cartographers regularly designed\n    maps peppered with scores of islands: islands that existed in a continuous\n    archipelago that directly linked the Americas to Asia. The woodcut world map\n    in Pietro Coppo\u2019s <em>De summa totius orbis</em> (Venice: Augustino di\n    Bindoni, 1528), for instance, shows the islands of southeast Asia flowing off\n    the right edge of the map and over onto the left, connecting India, Japan and\n    the proximate islands of the Caribbean. The 1515/1520 globes of Johann\n    Sch\xf6ner, as well as Sebastian M\xfcnster\u2019s map of\n    <em>New Islands (Nova Insulae</em>, 1550), also show the Americas as an\n    archipelago of Asia. Sch\xf6ner and M\xfcnster\u2019s maps depicted the Yucatan as an\n    island, and many sixteenth century maps similarly depicted an insular\n    California.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img\n            width="100%"\n            src="vopel-images/archipelagus.coppo.jpg"\n            alt="de summa totius orbis 1528"\n    />\n</p>\n\n<p>Pietro Coppo, <em>De summa totius orbis</em> (Venice, 1528).</p>\n<p>\n    <img\n            width="100%"\n            src="vopel-images/archipelagus.schoner.jpg"\n            alt="1520 terrestrial globe oceanus occidentalis"\n    />\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Johann Sch\xf6ner, 1520 terrestrial globe, Germanisches Nationalmuseum,\n    N\xfcremberg; here, seen in a historical illustration from the nineteenth\n    century, taken from Franz von Wieser,\n    <em\n    >Magalhaes-Strasse und Austral-Continent.

The\n    numerous Latin versions of Columbus\u2019s letter to Sant\xe1ngel, for instance, were\n    almost all entitled "Letter of Columbus, on the Islands of India Beyond the\n    Ganges Recently Discovered;\u201d Simon Grynaeus and Johann Huttich\u2019s\n    <em>Novus orbis</em> (Paris, 1532), which became the standard collection of\n    travel literature in Protestant Northern Europe, included in its full title\n    the phrase <em>New World of Regions and Islands Unknown to the Ancients</em>.\n    At the same time, isolarii, or encyclopedic texts that depicted world\n    geography as a series of islands also presented entirely new and more\n    comprehensive ways of understanding and viewing the world.<a\n        href="#_edn8"\n        name="_ednref8"\n>[8]</a\n>\n</p>\n<p>\n    These maps and texts were products of a European world-view grounded in late\n    medieval ideas that the limit of the world was signaled and surrounded by\n    thousands of islands. Islands were malleable and movable, offering a useful\n    means of understanding the constantly changing frontiers of early modern\n    global geography.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a> This insular\n    mentality helped to cast the Americas into a non-contiguous yet associated\n    relationship to Asia. According to Richard Flint, in the middle of the\n    sixteenth century \u201cEuropean cosmographers and cartographers still conceived of\n    the island and land masses that Columbus had seen nearly fifty years earlier\n    as eastward appendages and the periphery of Asia.\u201d<a\n        href="#_edn10"\n        name="_ednref10"\n>[10]</a\n>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Following the conquest of Tenochtitlan, in his third letter of 1523, Cort\xe9s\n    described how the discovery of a new coastline to the west had fired his\n    imagination: \u201c[A]ll those who have some learning and experience in the\n    navigation of the Indies are quite certain that once the route to the Southern\n    Sea has been discovered we shall find many islands rich in gold, pearls,\n    precious stones and spices.\u201d<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[11]</a> He\n    instructed his mariners to look for a maritime passage connecting the\n    Caribbean to the nearby Moluccas, revealing and affirming Sch\xf6ner and\n    M\xfcnster\u2019s vision of the insular nature of the Americas, as well as Mexico\u2019s\n    proximity to Asia.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</a> Along similar\n    lines, as Ricardo Padr\xf3n has pointed out, narratives of the 1543 Villalobos\n    expedition from Mexico to the Philippines do not describe this crossing as an\n    arduous passage across a vast ocean, but instead as a relatively easy hopping\n    across close islands.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</a> In sum, this\n    insular mentality resulted in the Amerasian understanding that the islands of\n    the Americas were not far from the legendary islands of Southeast Asia (link\n    to <a href="#moluccae">Moluccas entry</a>).\n</p>\n<p>\n    The term <em>Mare de Sur</em> was eventually replaced by the label Pacific or\n    \u201cpeaceful\u201d, so named by Magellan when he found calm waters there after\n    navigating through the stormy seas around Cape Horn. Abraham Ortelius\u2019s map\n    <em>Maris pacifici</em>, included in the 1589 edition of his\n    <em>Teatrum orbis terrarum</em> and often considered the first European map\n    dedicated to the Pacific, shows this transition.

The Greek geographer Marinus of Tyre (70-130 CE) described it as a\n    port city supposedly reached by a 1st century Greek trader named Alexander.\n    Both Alexander\u2019s periplus and Marinus\u2019 works have been lost, but Ptolemy cited\n    them both as authorities on the geography of Southeast Asia in his\n    <em>Geography</em>. He became interested in the precise location of this port,\n    which received considerable attention in his text; he placed it along the\n    eastern edge of the <em>Magnus Sinus</em> or what is today the Gulf of\n    Thailand, on the Golden Chersonese or what is today the Malay Peninsula (in\n    the very bottom right corner of his eleventh map of Asia).

Gog and Magog, kings of unclean nations and often\n    described as cannibals, appear in both the Hebrew Bible (Ezekiel 38, Genesis\n    10), as well as in the Book of Revelation (Revelation 20), at times as\n    peoples, lands, or tribes, and at times as individuals. According to medieval\n    romances, Alexander the Great drove them beyond a mountain pass and blocked\n    them from returning by constructing an impenetrable wall. On medieval maps,\n    they are sometimes depicted behind a wall, though not on Vopel\u2019s.

In addition, Vopel has placed\n    the kingdom of Gog and Magog and the lands of Shang-tu just to the west of\n    Greater Spain (Hispania Maior), which, the inscription reads, \u201cwas subdued by\n    Nu\xf1o de Guzman in the year 1530\u201d (<em\n>Haec a Numo Gusmano/ deuicta Anno 1530</em\n>).

Here, Vopel also notes that in the lands around\n    the Panuco River, \u201cthe Lord of the river from [Panucus] voluntarily subjected\n    himself, along with his entire dominion, to his Imperial Majesty, with Hern\xe1n\n    Cort\xe9s as a witness\u201d (<em\n>Dominus fluiij/ de panuco vltro/ secum vniuersa/ sua dirione [sic]\n    Caesa/reae Maiestati subie/cit teste Ferdinando Cortesio</em\n>).

Hispaniola, in fact, proved not to\n    be rich in gold at all, revealing how countless early modern European descriptions of the islands of the Caribbean\n    as overflowing with gold derived largely Marco Polo, and in particular, his description of the island of Japan. Polo\n    describes many wealthy regions of Asia, but among these, Japan ranks as one of the most dazzling.

Just as we roof our houses or churches with lead, so\n    this palace is roofed with fine gold. The value of it is almost beyond computation.

As the historian Lawrence Wroth put it,\n    Japan was \u201cthe shuttlecock of cartographers\u201d in the way that the placement of this island kingdom revealed a\n    cartographer\u2019s understanding of the relationship between East and West.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a> It\n    functioned, in effect, as a kind of cartographic lynchpin, a key to understanding a map or the globe as a whole, or\n    a clue to the encoding of cartographic knowledge, especially since up until the Portuguese arrival in Japan in the\n    1540s, the location of Japan relative to the coast of China was entirely derived from Polo\u2019s description of it and\n    could only be conjectured. The Johannes Ruysch map, included in the 1507 Roman edition of Ptolemy\u2019s\n    <em>Geography</em>, similarly claimed in a legend that Polo\u2019s Cipangu was Hispaniola. Ruysch\u2019s inscription to the\n    right of this island reads \u201cM.

He adopted Columbus\u2019 understanding of lands to the west by\n    making Japan an Amerasian island and asserting that the voyages of the Spaniards had identified Japan with\n    Hispaniola. </p>\n<p>\n    Europeans also often identified Hispaniola with Ophir and Tarshish, the site of King Solomon\u2019s wealth and gold\n    mines. (link to <a href="#riccio-ophir">Riccio essay on Ophir</a> and <a href="#tharsis">Tharsis entry</a>) In his\n    <i>First Decade</i>, for instance, written on November 13, 1493 not long after Columbus had returned from his first\n    expedition, Peter Martyr reported that Columbus had claimed\n    \u201cthat while he steered his ships eastward he discovered the island of Ophir.\u201d In 1501, Martyr again referred to\n    \u201cHispaniola, which [Columbus] claims is the Ophir about which one reads in the third book of Kings.\u201d<a href="#_edn4"\n                                                                                                           name="_ednref4">[4]</a>\n    The location of Ophir was much debated during the course of the sixteenth century; in 1625, Samuel Purchas devoted a\n    chapter of his travelogue <em>Purchase His Pilgrimes</em> to contesting the notion that Ophir was Hispaniola (<em>Purchase\n    His Pilgrimes</em>, 1:73-74). While Purchas was in doubt, he still felt the need to put the Amerasian idea to rest,\n    indicating how as late as 1625, Amerasia was not simply something to scoff at, but rather a still-prevailing\n    conception that needed to have arguments mounted against it. Vopel\u2019s placement of Japan on his map and Purchas\u2019\n    discussion of Hispaniola as Ophir both demonstrate how ideas about Amerasia didn\u2019t simply begin with Columbus and\n    diminish over time; they could go underground, resurface, re-blossom, and grow in unpredictable and unexpected new\n    places.</p>\n\n\n<div id=edn1>\n    <p>\n        <a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[1]</a> Marco Polo, <em>The Travels of Marco Polo</em>, trans.

For Hellenistic and Roman geographers, including\n    Pliny, Strabo, Solinus, and Alexandrian astronomer and geographer Claudius\n    Ptolemy, India was divided by the Ganges into two regions:\n    <em>India intra gangem</em>, comprised of lands between the Indus and the\n    Ganges, and <em>India extra gangem</em>, or India beyond the Ganges to the\n    East\u2014effectively, today, Southeast Asia&mdashfrom the Ganges river to China\n    (<em>Sinnae</em>), including modern Indochina, Indonesia, and countries on the\n    maritime coast between India and China.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"\n>[1]</a\n>\n    These lands were indicated on Ptolemy\u2019s eleventh map of Asia.

This allowed <em>India beyond the Ganges</em> to become a region\n    where \u201ctravelers, geographers, cartographers, and audiences engage in an\n    endless process of reinventing [it] in accordance with their own or their\n    culture\u2019s changing knowledge, needs, fears, and desires.\u201d<a\n        href="#_edn5"\n        name="_ednref5"\n>[5]</a\n>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Most importantly where Vopel\u2019s map is concerned, the remoteness and\n    inaccessibility of these Indian lands allowed early modern geographers\n    and cosmographers to understand <em>India extra gangem</em> as the location of\n    the Americas; these both exotic and lesser-known lands could be adapted to\n    encompass the Columbian voyages, which is why we see the toponym\n    <em>India Orientalis</em> just west of Mexico on Vopel\u2019s map. The concept of a\n    multi-partite India functioned like a geographical accordion that could easily\n    expand to incorporate newly discovered territories. It was for this reason\n    that Columbus described the inhabitants of the lands where he landed in the\n    western Atlantic the Indies (<em>las Indias</em>), and its inhabitants as\n    Indians (<em>Indios</em>), language that would prove of enormous consequence\n    in establishing an Amerasian understanding of where Columbus had gone.

It was in Spanish imperial interests that the Americas continue to be\n    closely linked to the Moluccas and its wealth. Thus, for several decades after\n    Magellan\u2019s voyage, including here on the Vopel map, Spanish sources continued\n    to represent the Pacific as a relatively narrow expanse. In his recounting of\n    the Magellan expedition in the first four books of his\n    <em>Historia general y natural de las Indias</em> (1535), for instance, the\n    Spanish historian Gonzalo Fern\xe1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\xe9s edited Pigafetta\u2019s\n    original summary of Magellan\u2019s voyage to leave out Pigafetta\u2019s detailed\n    description of the hunger, thirst, and scurvy that plagued Magellan\u2019s crew,\n    thereby downplaying the enormous distance that Magellan crossed.<a\n        href="#_edn1"\n        name="_ednref1"\n>[1]</a\n>\n</p>\n<p>\n    In Vopel\u2019s depiction, Magellan is shown taking off from the Amerasian coast.\n    He is not crossing the Pacific; he is crossing the Mar del Sur, or the South\n  China Sea. (link to <a href="#archipelagus">Archipelagus entry</a>) As this combination shows, Magellan\u2019s\n    circumnavigation of the globe did not result in the conceptual separation of\n    America and Asia once and for all. In his\n    <em>Opusculum Geographicum ex diversorum libris ac cartis </em> (Nuremberg,\n    1533), Johann Sch\xf6ner argued that Magellan\u2019s circumnavigation in fact\n    confirmed that America and Asia were the same place.\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    After the time of Ptolemy, many regions were discovered beyond 180 degrees to\n    the East by one Marco Polo of Venice and others, and in recent times these\n    regions have been visited by Columbus of Genoa and Amerigo Vespucci, who,\n    however, sailing thither from Spain through the Western Ocean, explored the\n    coasts only and, judging this part of the world to be an island, called it\n    America, the fourth part of the world. But now, through the latest voyages\n    accomplished in 1519 by Magellan, admiral of the ships of the invincible\n    Emperor the divine Charles etc,. to the Moluccas which others call Maluquas,\n    situated in the farthest East, it has been found that this land is the\n    continent of Upper India, which is part of Asia.<a\n        href="#_edn2"\n        name="_ednref2"\n>[2]</a\n>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    Most scholars agree that old ideas were slow to die in the face of discoveries\n    like Magellan\'s; occasionally, as in this example, increasing information\n    actually gave new life and new shape to the Amerasian picture, since\n    Magellan\u2019s voyage proved for Sch\xf6ner, one of the most reputable cosmographers\n    of his day, that America was part of Asia.

For\n  example, when the Franciscan explorer Franciscan Marcos de Niza returned to\n  Mexico City after his journey into the American southwest in 1539, a great\n  variety of people who heard his account reported his sighting of elephants,\n  camels, and people wearing silk in what is today New Mexico.

The Tangut Empire occupied a\n    stretch of the Silk Road, and its wealth clearly attracted Vopel\u2019s attention,\n    as we can see by the copious number of cities and their wares from this part\n    of China, such as silk and camels, that Vopel decided to include and describe\n    on his map. Describing the city of Kalachan\u2014not included on Vopel\u2019s map, but\n    noted by Polo in the province of Tangut\u2014Polo states for instance that \u201cin this\n    city the finest camlets in the world are made of camel hair.\u201d<a\n        href="#_edn2"\n        name="_ednref2"\n>[2]</a\n>\n    Camlet was a luxurious fabric traditionally made from a combination of silk\n    and camel hair.

It was often divided into regions held by different ruling\n    powers, such as Muscovite Tartary, Cathay Tartary (Xinjiang and Mongolia,\n    indicated on Vopel\u2019s map just to the east of <em>Tartaria Magna</em>).\n</p>\n<p>\n    One tribe of the Mongol confederacy bore the name Tatar, a word that for some\n    Europeans recalled Tartarus, the hell of classical mythology. Especially after\n    the passage of Mongol armies laid waste large parts of Central Asia in the\n    middle of the thirteenth century, it became commonplace for the term Tatar or\n    Tartar to stand in for the Mongols in general, as Europeans began referring to\n    them as a kind of generic diabolical horde.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"\n>[1]</a\n>\n    When Polo uses the term Tartar, which he does regularly throughout his text,\n    he is referring to the Mongols.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The Tartars sometimes figured in Amerasian understandings of the world, often\n    through rhetorics of similarity that likened them to New World peoples.

For instance, the chronicler Fray Diego de Oca\xf1a described a civic\n    ritual that took place in Potos\xed in 1601 in which a figure dressed as the\n    devil threw printed broadsheets to the crowd that proclaimed \u201cthe Prince of\n    Tartary, who of sulphur/sustains himself in the dark cavern,/will present\n    himself at half past five,/and he thanks those who shall suffer until then.\u201d<a\n        href="#_edn4"\n        name="_ednref4"\n>[4]</a\n>\n    While Potosiani may not have literally believed that the Prince of Tartary was\n    hiding in a cave in a nearby valley, they nevertheless felt his presence.

Its author, canon Lambert of\n    Saint-Omer, frames his diagrammatic approach to natural history\n    Christologically, orienting his\n    <a href="http://diglib.hab.de/mss/1-gud-lat/start.htm?image=00144"\n    >stunning mappamundi</a\n    >\n    (Fig. 1) with the furthest reaches of the east at the top, symbolizing the\n    origin point of both the beginning and end of the world: an extant paradise\n    that is the site of both the creation of man and the second coming of Christ\n    at the apocalypse.\n</p>\n<img width="100%"\n     src="walshthomas-images/WalshThomas-fig1a.png"\n     alt="Description: left side of the mappamundi (69verso)"\n/>\n<img width="100%"\n     src="walshthomas-images/WalshThomas-fig1b.png"\n     alt="Description: right side of the mappamundi (70recto)"\n/>\n<p>\n    Fig. 1: <i>Mappamundi,</i> Lambert of Saint-Omer,\n    <i>Liber Floridus,</i> 69v-70r.

For despite its proximity to the garden of\n    Eden, India was also a land of monstrous marvels: Lambert of Saint-Omer\n    illustrates this tension in his map, where we can see in the map"s labeling\n    that India is the land of "<i>pigmei</i>" and "<i>fauni</i>" in addition to\n    "<i>reges</i> <i>gentium</i>" (kings of nations).\n</p>\n<p>\n    This dual Indian imaginary is carried forward in both the textual and the\n    cartographical traditions of the later Middle Ages, forming the body of\n    evidence upon which many of the first explorers of the New World would later\n    base their observations. Furthermore, the particular story of Saint Thomas was\n    well known, popularized as it was by de Voragine\'s <i>Legenda Aurea</i>. This\n    account tells of Thomas\' conscription as an architect by King Gundophorus of\n    India. While the king is away on stately business, Thomas uses the funds\n    allocated for construction of the palace to feed the poor, and successfully\n    evangelizes much of the royal court which enrages the king upon his return. In\n    retribution, he subjects Thomas to numerous tortures that are prevented by\n    miraculous intervention. Finally, the king commands Thomas to sacrifice to a\n    pagan idol, but the idol is destroyed at Thomas\' word in a demonstration of\n    the superior power of the Christian God. He is then killed by the high priest\n    out of vengeance.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a> This\n    account was important and established enough to be included in the\n    <a\n            href="http://www.medievalart.org.uk/chartres/23_pages/Chartres_Bay23_key.htm"\n    >windows of Chartres Cathedral</a\n    >, where a full cycle of the apostle\'s exploits in India leading up to his\n    eventual martyrdom can be found in a twenty-eight vitrine cycle. Based on this\n    foundational story, popular travel accounts such as Marco Polo\'s\n    <i>Travels</i> of the early fourteenth century and John Mandeville\'s\n    <i>Livre de Merveilles</i> some sixty years later both refer to the site and\n    milieu of the saint"s resting place in India. Polo states:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    The body of Messer Saint Thomas the Apostle is in the province of Malabar, in\n    a little city; for there are few men there; nor do merchants come there, for\n    there is no merchandise that can be exported and, what\'s more, the place is\n    very out of the way. It is quite true that many Christians and many Saracens\n    come here for pilgrimage: for I tell you that the Saracens of this country\n    have great faith in him; they say that he was Saracen and that he is a great\n    prophet, and they call him avarian, which means "holy man"<a\n        href="#_edn8"\n        name="_ednref8"\n        title=""\n>[8]</a\n>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mandeville concurs:</p>\n<blockquote>\n    Fro this londe men goth many contreis and journees to a contr\' that is called\n    Mabaron. And that is a gret contry and a gret kyngdome, and ther beth many\n    fair citees and tounes.

And to that ymage men cometh fro ferre contrees with gret devocioun in\n    pylgrimage.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    These accounts built on the existing legend of Saint Thomas, providing\n    additional information about the Indian context of his martyrdom and shrine,\n    including miracles performed by the martyr\'s relics, the idols of Indian\n    people (Mandeville in particular describes an ox-headed idol<a\n        href="#_edn10"\n        name="_ednref10"\n        title=""\n>[10]</a\n>, Polo describes idols painted black<a\n        href="#_edn11"\n        name="_ednref11"\n        title=""\n>[11]</a\n>), and other cultural practices such as reverence toward cows. In total, they\n    imagine a contemporary India that is a crossroads of pagan faiths where the\n    legacy of the saint endures as a testament to the presence and preeminence of\n    Christian virtue amidst spiritual decline.\n</p>\n<p>\n    It is on this basis that the navigational initiatives of explorers such as\n    Christopher Columbus, Amerigo Vespucci, and Vasco de Gama, would have\n    anticipated signs of Christianity in newly encountered lands. Though the\n    medieval fervor of finding Prester John tapered off in the preceding\n    century,<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a> the ongoing\n    popularity of texts like Polo\'s <i>Travels</i>&#8211;newly published in\n    Portugal in 1502 with a dedication to "those who now go to the indies"<a\n        href="#_edn13"\n        name="_ednref13"\n        title=""\n>[13]</a\n>&#8211;as well as the <i>Legenda Aurea</i>, assured that the legend of Thomas\n    remained alive and well on the eve of the Age of Encounters. As such, a new\n    round of accounts began to report the presence of Thomas in the New World.\n    This seeming geographic confusion is elucidated by the early letters of\n    Christopher Columbus, which frequently refer to the New World as the "Indies"\n    and people within them as "Indians." Though the exact geography of the islands\n    he landed on did not match the trusted descriptions in Marco Polo\'s text,\n    other elements of his encounters clearly corresponded with his expectations of\n    an immense material abundance in Asia, including the presence of highly\n    desirable spices and cotton.<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""\n>[14]</a\n>\n    In addition to these worldly concerns, his copious observations about the\n    spiritual disposition of the natives he encountered<a\n        href="#_edn15"\n        name="_ednref15"\n        title=""\n>[15]</a\n>\n    reflected the evangelical ambitions that would galvanize the Spanish imperial\n    enterprise in the years to come. For many of the missionaries who would\n    passionately undertake the immense task of native conversion, the legend of\n    Saint Thomas would become an important underlying mythology and a lightning\n    rod for the moral quandary of the condition of native humanity.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Despite Saint Thomas appearing on maps as early as Martin Waldseem\xfcller\'s\n    <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/2003626426/">Universalis Cosmographia</a> of\n    1507, scholar Louis-Andr\xe9 Vigneras has pinpointed a 1514 travel account printed\n    in Augsburg as the first eyewitness report of the apostle in the landmass\n    recently named "America".\n</p>\n<img width="100%"\n     src="walshthomas-images/WalshThomas-fig2.jpg"\n     alt="Description: Waldseem\xfcller world map"\n/>\n<p>\n    Fig. 2: Martin Waldseem\xfcller,\n    <i\n    >Universalis cosmographia secundum Ptholomaei traditionem et Americi\n        Vespucii alioru[m]que lustrationes, </i\n    >ca. 1507, Strasbourg, France.\n</p>\n<p>\n    In the <i>Copia der Newen Zeytung ausz Prasillg Landt</i> (Tidings out of\n    Brazil), the author&#8211; a Portuguese or Italian trader&#8211; states:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    "on this same coast they [the natives of Brazil] cherish the memory of Saint\n    Thomas, they refer to him as the lesser god.

Notwithstanding their\n    experience navigating in the region, and the circulation of maps like\n    WWaldseem\xfcller\u2019s and Sch\xf6ner\'s theorizing the New World as a separate\n    continent, there was no reason to categorically dissociate Indian Christians\n    with the accounts of Thomas and the spiritual potential in the New World. Two\n    years before both the completion of the Magellan mission across the Pacific\n    and the Portuguese discovery of an overgrown Christian shrine and tomb at\n    Mylapore on the Malabar coast of India, the manufacture of a richly\n    illuminated atlas indicated that the Portuguese worldview still held the newly\n    discovered lands in the Atlantic as part and parcel to a greater Asian\n    landmass. The atlas, created for King Manuel I in 1519 and now referred to as\n    the Miller Atlas, depicts many vibrant illustrations of the inhabitants of the\n    diverse lands of the world and shows a remarkable geographic accuracy with\n    regards to the continental contours of the southern and southeast Asian\n    regions. However, the\n    <a href="https://www.wdl.org/en/item/18562/">stunning frontispiece</a> (Fig.\n    4) depicting a full, global map shows the Asian continent continuing eastward\n    along the edge of the world and circumscribing the Indian Ocean, connecting to\n    a great southern "Terra Incognita" before curving upward on the opposite side\n    to reunite with a landmass clearly labeled "Mundus Novus, Brasil."\n</p>\n<img width="100%"\n\n     src="walshthomas-images/WalshThomas-fig4.png"\n     alt="Description: Circular World Map showing the Portuguese Hemisphere with four winds from the Nautical Atlas of the World"\n/>\n<p>\n    Fig. 4:\n    <i\n    >Nautical Atlas of the World, Circular World Map of the Portuguese\n        Hemisphere and Title Page, </i\n    >Pedro Reinel, Jorge Reinel, Lopo Homem, and Ant\xf3nio de Holanda, The Miller\n    Atlas,ca. 1519. 59x 41.5 cm.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Nevertheless, in 1521 excavations at Mylapore overseen by Captain Pero Lopes\n    de Sampayo and documented firsthand by Gaspar Correia in his\n    <i>Lendas da \xcdndia</i>, uncovered a domed chapel and tomb replete with cross\n    motifs and preserved relics, compelling evidence that the search for the\n    Ptolemaic India that lived on in the work of Polo and Mandeville had come to a\n    victorious end.<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    As the image of these new worlds continued to take shape, the discoveries at\n    Mylapore did not have conclusive impact. They were challenged by missionaries\n    in both Spanish and Portuguese camps on the basis of other premodern accounts\n    stating that though Thomas preached and was martyred in India, his relics were\n    transported to the city of Edessa in Asia Minor after his death. This was an\n    especially popular argument of Spanish skeptics like Antonio de Torquemada who\n    took the account of Isidore of Seville as the most authoritative.<a\n        href="#_edn19"\n        name="_ednref19"\n        title=""\n>[19]</a\n>\n    The existence of a venerable and privileged community of native Christians in\n    the Indian subcontinent was enough to verify an apostolic presence but the\n    questionable validity of the relics proved problematic to the Portuguese as\n    well, particularly the Jesuits. Additionally, missionaries faced the question\n    of religious lapse: when interpreting the customs of the self-identified\n    Church of Saint Thomas, the influence of Syriac and Persian Christian\n    traditions and the diverse interfaith milieu of southern India failed to\n    conform to the vision of a Christian Eden prescribed by the legend. Despite\n    the professed devotion of the Saint Thomas Christians, their practices were\n    nonetheless seen as heretical with regards to Roman rite, perhaps reinforced\n    by a unique regional iconography that bore similarity to Buddhist traditions\n    in its depictions of angels and its use of animal motifs.<a\n        href="#_edn20"\n        name="_ednref20"\n        title=""\n>[20]</a\n>\n    This tension may be best encapsulated by the lengthy title of one of the first\n    significant European histories describing the Saint Thomas Christian\n    community, Ant\xf3nio de Gouvea\'s\n    <i\n    >Jornada do arcebispo de Goa Dom Frey Aleixo de Menezes primaz da India\n        oriental </i\n    >of 1606, the full title of which can be translated as "Journey of the\n    Archbishop of Goa, Dom Frey Aleixo de Menezes, Primate of East India,\n    Religious of the Order of St. Augustine, when he went to the Mountains of\n    Malabar and the places where the Ancient Christians of Saint Thomas reside and\n    brought them away from many errors and heresies in which they were mired, and\n    reduced them to our Holy Catholic Faith, and obedience to the Holy Roman\n    Church, from which they had been separated for more than a thousand years."<a\n        href="#_edn21"\n        name="_ednref21"\n        title=""\n>[21]</a\n>\n</p>\n<p>\n    In the New World, Spanish missionaries either seeking genuine evidence of the\n    apostle or merely seeking inroads to capturing the native imagination in order\n    to clear a path to conversion, recognized parallels between Thomas, Moses, and\n    Christ and native Gods, particularly the figure of Topiltzin-Quetzalcoatl in\n    Mexico. The Dominican friar Diego Dur\xe1n, who was born in New Spain in the late\n    1530s and worked as a missionary in both Mexico City and Oaxaca, learned\n    Nahuatl and dedicated significant study to the Aztec religion as a means to\n    better penetrate and overtake it. In doing so, he identified the remarkable\n    similarities between Aztec and Christian rites that suggested biblical origins\n    for the people of Mexico and a specific heritage of the apostolic tradition.\n    Though he is wary of directly conflating Saint Thomas with\n    Topiltzin-Quetzalcoatl, the mythological ruler of the Toltecs, he nonetheless\n    catalogs their compelling similarities as an unmistakable continuum of\n    Thomas\' apostolic mission, stating:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n    "I would not dare affirm that Topiltzin was one of the blessed Apostles. Nevertheless, the story of his life has\n    impressed me greatly and has led me and others to believe that, since the natives were also God\u2019s creatures,\n    rational and capable of salvation, He cannot have left them without a preacher of the Gospel. And if this is true,\n    that preacher was Topiltzin, who came to this land. According to the story, he was a sculptor who carved admirable\n    images in stone. We read that the glorious apostle Saint Thomas was a master craftsman in the same art." <a\n        href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[22]</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    Topiltzin was a man who had come from a foreign country. This indicates that\n    he appeared in this land [as a newcomer], since I can find no account of his\n    homeland. However, it is well known, that after he arrived in this country he\n    began to gather disciples and to build churches and altars Thus we can\n    probably deduce that this man was an apostle whom God sent to this land and\n    that the rest of them, the master craftsmen or wise men, were his disciples.<a\n        href="#_edn23"\n        name="_ednref23"\n        title=""\n>[23]</a\n>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Dur\xe1n was not the first. Letters from missionaries in Brazil attest to the\n    apostle\'s presence there: in 1538, Fray Bernardo de Armencia identified Thomas\n    in the Guaran\xed wise man figure of Pay\xf3ume, also known as Pay Thome, and in\n    1549 Jesuit Manuel de N\xf3brega stated in his letters home "that without doubt,\n    the apostle Thomas had preached in Brazil."<a\n        href="#_edn24"\n        name="_ednref24"\n        title=""\n>[24]</a\n>\n    Furthermore, the presence of cruciform imagery in the native iconographical\n    traditions of the Maya and the Inca confirmed for missionaries the presence of\n    an prior Christian presence in the Americas, and was reiterated in the\n    influential writings of chroniclers Fern\xe1ndez de Oviedo, Francisco L\xf3pez de\n    G\xf3mara, and Peter Martyr.<a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title="">[25]</a>\n    These monumental similarities with the findings at Mylapore contributed to an\n    ongoing flexibility in the role India played in these missionaries\' Amerasian\n    understanding of global geography.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Despite the vastly disparate cultures encountered in new territories by the\n    Spanish and Portuguese respectively, they found a common problem related to\n    their anticipation of a Christian presence: the religious realities they\n    found, whether genuinely Christian or pagan in tradition, differed vastly from\n    the precedent set up by the legend of Saint Thomas in antique and medieval\n    literature. This evangelical dilemma correlated with and contributed to a\n    wider European practice of conflating new geographic discoveries. The\n    interchangeable imaginary of South America and the Indian subcontinent long\n    after the 1521 excavations at Mylapore was as much due to the kind of\n    geographic continuity demonstrated by the frontispiece of Miller Atlas and the\n    Vopel Map as it was a compression of diverse characteristics into common\n    cultural "other" defined by its polytheism, its exoticism, its complexion and\n    nakedness, and its proximity to the tropical abundance that the nascent\n    nations of Europe were seeking to access. This conflation expressed itself in\n    an artistic culture that portrayed the "Indians" of the New World and the\n    Indians of Asia with indistinguishable physical attributes, perhaps best\n    illustrated in the widely circulated 1508 Hans Burgkmair print series\n    <i>The Triumph of Maximilian I.</i> In a print titled\n    <a\n            href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=57004001&amp;objectId=1440883&amp;partId=1"\n    >&quot;The People of Calicut&quot;,</a\n    >\n    depicting a procession of Indian people clothed in a manner that intertwines\n    aspects of indigenous New World dress and attributes&#8211; feathered\n    clothing, maize, jaguar skins&#8211; with creatures of pan-tropical origin&mdash;\n    parrots and monkeys.\n</p>\n<img width="100%"\n     src="walshthomas-images/WalshThomas-fig5.jpg"\n     alt="Description: People of Calicut detail of Various Indians Carrying Weapons, Goods, and Animals"\n/>\n<p>\n    Fig. 5: Hans Burgkmair the Elder,\n    <i>The Triumph of Maximilian I: The People of Calicut, </i>ca. 1516-1518.\n    Woodblock Print, 27.3 x 37.5 cm.

In the\n    background a similarly dressed figure who is seated astride a camel and\n    sheltered by what appears to be a feathered parasol gazes imperiously over the\n    scene. The landscape is further populated by palm trees to the right and\n    treehouses occupying a distant canopy to the left. This scene appears to\n    represent an amalgam of cultural signifiers, each with their own encoded\n    geographical identity that today, in the twenty-first century, we view as\n    distinct: the feathered headdresses of indigenous American peoples, the camel\n    of North African and Middle Eastern nomads, the parasols of the far east, and\n    the palm trees of a pan-tropical ecology.\n</p>\n<p>\n    As the seventeenth century progressed, Thomas\' role as an explicit geographic\n    reference point waned, though his symbolic importance as exemplar for\n    missionaries in the Reformation remained.

The Martyrdom of Saint Thomas was not a\n    popular subject for European painting in the Renaissance, but Rubens had\n    mingled the iconography of another altarpiece that perhaps indicates the\n    changing significance of Saint Thomas as a spiritual and colonial model.

The crowd itself\n    bears a range of non-European cultural signifiers: the dark complexions of\n    sub-Saharan Africa, Turkish turbans, a queue hairstyle that could correspond\n    either to Chinese or Indian sources, and even a man fully dressed in a Joseon\n    dynasty Korean <i>banggeon</i> and <i>dapho</i>, although Xavier was never\n    known to have gone to Korea or mainland China.<a\n        href="#_edn30"\n        name="_ednref30"\n        title=""\n>[30]</a\n>\n    Though there may have been genuine confusion between the costumes of different\n    east Asian cultures of the time, the effect of the painting is not one of\n    confusion, or conflation, but rather of symbolic convergence: the many and\n    disparate idolators of the world gathered together to receive the word of\n    Christ. The dialogue between the paintings points to a shift in the meaning of\n    the Thomasine legacy. Where the apostle established the mission of the ancient\n    church, Xavier and the Jesuits follow to manifest it in the modern age. Rather\n    than representing a medieval vision of the east, of Eden and Prester John, an\n    extant Christian land to be rediscovered and reclaimed, Thomas now projects\n    into the future toward a global Christian empire precipitated by the holy\n    office of the missionary.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Though the presence of the Saint Thomas Christians at Mylapore provided\n    overwhelming evidence of his missionary trajectory that is still held valid by\n    biblical historians today, the inexact definition of India both as a cultural\n    and territorial entity in the 16th century made these findings far from\n    definitive. The same simultaneity with which Caspar Vopel depicted Thomas, he\n    also applied to India itself, the Indias prima, media, and ulteriore of\n    medieval mappaemundi having evolved and survived as Vopel\'s Indias "maior\n    Aethiopiae", "intra Gangem", and "extra Gangem", with the new appendage of\n    "India orientalis" extending just north from the sails of Saint Thomas to the\n    western edge of the map, apparently continuing onward to merge with the other\n    side. (link to <a href="#riccio-india">Riccio India entry</a>) Finally, let us return to de Voragine\'s\n    etymology of Thomas: totus means, total wanderer. The <i>Legenda Aurea </i>and\n    its ensuing tradition localize the saint\'s ultimate destination in India, but\n    not only did India\'s perceived parameters merely grow to assimilate new lands\n    into an existing global model, the missionary vocation by its very nature is\n    one of continual displacement, its goal expansive, not restrictive. The legend\n    provided an incredibly malleable framework through which to interpret the new\n    into Eurocentric visions of a Christian world empire. As the unimaginably vast\n    scope of global geography came slowly into view throughout the age of\n    exploration, the potential for apostolic discovery only multiplied, and with\n    it the geographic understanding of the Indies.\n</p>\n\n\n<hr/>\n\n<div id="edn1">\n    <p>\n        <a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[1]</a> Jacobus de Voragine,\n        <i>The Golden Legend:</i> <i>Readings on the Saints</i> (Princeton:\n        Princeton University Press, 2012).\n    </p>\n</div>\n<div id="edn2">\n    <p>\n        <a href="#_ednref2" name="_edn2" title="">[2]</a> Louis-Andr\xe9 Vigneras,\n        "Saint Thomas, Apostle of America,"\n        <i>The Hispanic American Historical Review</i> 57 (1977): 82-90, at 84.\n    </p>\n</div>\n<div id="edn3">\n    <p>\n        <a href="#_ednref3" name="_edn3" title="">[3]</a> Marianne O\u2019Doherty,\n        <i>The Indies and the Medieval West: Thought, Report, Imagination </i\n        >(Turnhout, Belgium: Brepols, 2013), 35.\n    </p>\n</div>\n<div id="edn4">\n    <p>\n        <a href="#_ednref4" name="_edn4" title="">[4]</a> Herzog Augustbibliothek,\n        Wolfenb\xfcttle, Cod.

He connected these monsters to\n    another local legend about a tribe of female warriors who according to locals\n    inhabited the island of Matinino, east of Hispaniola ("first island of the\n    Indies, closest to Spain," perhaps Guadeloupe), an island that he speculated\n    men visited only intermittently for mating, an account that draws on Marco\n    Polo\u2019s \u201cisland of women\u201d located in the Indian Ocean.<a\n        href="#_edn3"\n        name="_ednref3"\n>[3]</a\n>\n    He ends, however, on an optimistic note, having heard from locals about a\n    large island nearby which "abounds in countless gold" (<em\n>en esta ay oro sin cuenta</em\n>).\n</p>\n\n<img\n        width="100%"\n        src="vopel-images/aethiopia.jpg"\n        alt="woodcut showing encounters of natives"\n/>\n\n<p>\n    A woodcut accompanying the 1494 Basel edition of Columbus\u2019 letter shows some\n    natives fleeing the new landed visitors to Hispaniola. The two figures shown\n    arriving along the coast in a boat are not the natives of the place, but\n    traders from the larger region. One is shown wearing a turban, the other\n    wearing a Phrygian cap, marking them as eastern traders. The detail corresponds\n    with Columbus\u2019 description of a trade network connecting various islands with\n    what he imagined to be a mainland, an Asian mainland, not far away. The ship\n    at the bottom of the woodcut is not a representation of Columbus\u2019 ship, but\n    rather of the traders visiting the coast in the dinghy. Though a highly\n    abbreviated image, the woodcut clarifies that before Columbus\u2019 arrival,\n    narrated in the accompanying letter, these people were in contact with Asian\n    seafarers using ships comparable to those of Columbus\u2019 crew and equipped with\n    proper rigging. In contrast, Columbus observes in the letter, the canoes of\n    the locals do not have sails, though they too are impressive vessels, equipped\n    with many oars, big enough to hold seventy to eighty men, and able to travel over far\n    distances.\n</p>\n<p>\n    In sum, both in terms of the ways it described these new lands, as well as in\n    terms of the volume of its reproduction in print, Columbus\u2019 letter to\n    Sant\xe1ngel played an early and essential role in establishing the overlap\n    between Asia and newly discovered lands in the western Atlantic.\n</p>\n\n<div id="edn1">\n    <p>\n        <a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[1]</a> See Cecil H.

Its powers and responsibilities included\n    financial and legal matters having to do with overseas trade (including the\n    levying of taxes upon goods returning from the Americas to Spain), the\n    movement of people around the Spanish global empire, the training of\n    navigators, and the creation and maintenance of maps and charts. Mapmaking was\n    an enormous undertaking at the <em>Casa</em>, which came to employ a sizable\n    contingent of cartographers as Spain\'s overseas empire expanded. In particular\n    where mapmaking was concerned, the <em>Casa</em> maintained a master map\n    called the <em>Padr\xf3n Real</em> by extracting cartographic information from\n    each ship as it returned from overseas and integrating this information in\n    Seville.\n</p>\n<p>\n    As one example of the collection of this geographic information, the\n    Portuguese cartographer Diogo Ribeiro worked on the official maps of the\n    <em>Padr\xf3n Real</em>, including the 1527 edition of this map, for which he\n    employed information from Magellan\u2019s voyage around the world to delineate the\n    coasts of Central and South America. On the one hand, Ribeiro\u2019s map appears to\n    show the vastness of the Pacific, suggesting the separation of Asia and\n    America. On the other hand, however, if we look more closely, a chain of ships\n    links the Americas to the Moluccas, implying a maritime relationship between\n    the two, and the west coast of the North American continent is left unfinished\n    and therefore in an unclear relationship to Asia. In this way, Diogo Ribeiro\u2019s\n    map embraced a form of cartographic imperialism that allowed the Spanish to\n    consider the lands of Asia as part of their growing American empire: an idea\n    that surely interested the <em>Casa de Contratac\xedon</em> in Seville. To put it\n    another way, even maps like Ribeiro\u2019s&#8212maps that showed an expanding\n    Pacific--could still embrace Amerasian thinking.\n</p>\n\n<img\n        width="100%"\n        src="vopel-images/sibilia.ribeiro.jpg"\n        alt="Ribeiro Padr\xf3n real map"\n/>\n'}]),[[147,2,1]]]);
