Before this painting, parrots had not often been included in religious\n    imagery.<a href="#_lipsman_edn3" name="_lipsman_ednref3" title=""><sup>[3]</sup></a> To understand the parrot\u2019s presence in this image and its increasing popularity after\n    Columbus\u2019s initial voyages to the lands we now know as the Americas, we need to examine the bird\u2019s association with\n    Paradise.</p>\n<p>During the Middle Ages in Europe it was widely believed that Eden was in the East. The parrots Europe traded for were\n    primarily Asian birds. In recognizing these two points, the connection between parrots and Paradise becomes\n    apparent. They had been paired with other exotic birds, like their fellow Indian species, the peacock, in depictions\n    of Paradise. This context makes the individual parakeet\u2019s inclusion in van Eyck\u2019s pre-Columbus painting all the more\n    puzzling.<a href="#_lipsman_edn4"\n                name="_lipsman_ednref4"\n                title=""><sup>[4]</sup></a> The painting does not depict a garden or an outdoor scene at all. Instead, the canon\n    kneels in prayer with Saints Donation and George flanking the panel and the Virgin, Child, and parakeet enthroned as\n    a trio in the center. The animal\u2019s ability to speak gives us some explanation for its association with Eden and\n    account for its presence in van Eyck\u2019s panel.</p>\n<p>The speaking bird was thought to say \u201c<i>Ave</i>\u201d in greeting, just as the archangel Gabriel had said to the Virgin\n    Mary in the Annunciation. Dominican Franciscus di Retza wrote of the bird\u2019s word in connection with Gabriel\u2019s\n    greeting, linking the parrot with the angel and the Annunciation.<a\n            href="#_lipsman_edn5"\n            name="_lipsman_ednref5"\n            title=""><sup>[5]</sup></a> In addition to voice, the impermeability of the parrot\u2019s green feathers was associated\n    with Mary\u2019s virginity. The combination of these elements identify the bird as an \u201cangelic\n    messenger.\u201d<a href="#_lipsman_edn6"\n                  name="_lipsman_ednref6"\n                  title=""><sup>[6]</sup></a> Beyond the association with the Virgin, Carol Purtle explains that because the\n    Christ Child is playing with the bird, the parakeet places the scene in heaven, rather than in an earthly\n    paradise.<a href="#_lipsman_edn7"\n                name="_lipsman_ednref7"\n                title=""><sup>[7]</sup></a> Instead of having it serve as a messenger to the Virgin, van Eyck intentionally\n    placed the parrot in Christ\u2019s hands, relating it to both the Child and His mother. Mary and Christ were often\n    understood to be the new Adam and Eve, and the bird positioned between them may allude to this succession. By making\n    the viewer recall the original residents of Paradise, the parrot\u2019s presence works with the silk hung behind the\n    group. The cloth\u2019s rose pattern on a green background refers to enclosed gardens: Eden, metaphors for Mary\u2019s\n    virginity, and, in literature of the time, \u201ca mystic setting for transcendent experience.\u201d<a href="#_lipsman_edn8"\n                                                                                                 name="_lipsman_ednref8"\n                                                                                                 title=""><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>\n<p> Purtle and John Ward have both proposed that the canon is having a vision of his postmortem introduction to Christ\n    in heaven.<a href="#_lipsman_edn9"\n                 name="_lipsman_ednref9"\n                 title=""><sup>[9]</sup></a> This interpretation clarifies the parrot\u2019s participation in the scene. The panel was\n    commissioned for van der Paele\u2019s tomb as his health declined, meaning that it was created with a particular\n    awareness of the canon\u2019s mortality. Known for its greeting of <i>\u201cAve\u201d </i>and its association with Paradise, the\n    parrot turns to him and welcomes him to heaven.<a href="#_lipsman_edn10"\n                                                      name="_lipsman_ednref10"\n                                                      title=""><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>\n<p>Van Eyck\u2019s composition of the Virgin and Child with a green parakeet was imitated again and again over the course of\n    the next century and a half. After Columbus\u2019s voyages and the arrival of American parrots in Europe however, we see\n    parrots appear in art more often. We also see a greater diversity in the species represented. Soon after Columbus\u2019s\n    voyages, we see ever more frequent depictions of macaws, a group of parrot subspecies native to the Americas. Over\n    the course of the 16<sup>th</sup>century, Europeans became accustomed to these new parrots and began depicting them\n    alongside African and Asian species. By the 17<sup>th</sup>century, parrots of all kinds were relatively common in\n    Europe and appeared with some regularity in still lives as well as narrative scenes.<a href="#_lipsman_edn11"\n                                                                                           name="_lipsman_ednref11"\n                                                                                           title=""><sup>[11]</sup></a>\n</p>\n<p>Many visitors to the new lands across the Atlantic remarked upon the large flocks of parrots found there.

With no border or coast in the West,\n    Cantino leaves the possibility the mass we now call South America may continue on into Asia. This idea is confirmed\n    by the map\u2019s original title, <i>Carta de navigar per le Isole nouam tr<sup>[ovate]</sup>in le parte de India: dono Alberto\n        Cantino al S. Duca Hercole </i> or <i>Map for navigating the new islands found in the parts of India: a gift of\n        Alberto Cantino for S. Duke Hercole </i> . Though he is depicting unexplored territory, Cantino follows\n    Columbus\u2019s example and assimilates it into Europe\u2019s existing understanding of the world by describing it as part of\n    India. The familiar green parrots of modern-day Senegal and African Grey Parrots of Central Africa are contrasted\n    with the bright red macaws of America. The depiction of a species on more than one continent is atypical, even of\n    later maps. Cartographers usually used animals to mark differences between places.</p>\n<p>Here on the Vopel Map<i>, </i>Cabral\u2019s \u201cland of the parrots\u201d is indicated twice. First, it appears in its Latin\n    translation, \u201c <i>Papagalli</i> <i> terra\u201d </i>on the landmass we now recognize as South America. The second\n    appearance of parrots is in a fictional land placed in the same location as Antarctica. They are depicted in the\n    eastern half of a land mass labeled as \u201c Antarcticus \u201d and \u201cTerra Australis nondum cognita ,\u201d which translates to\n    \u201cSouthern land not yet known\u201d.

This interpretation of the new lands may account for why, after Columbus\u2019s voyages, parrots\n    appear less in places believed to be Asia in the East and more in places believed to be Asia in the West. The\n    assembling of different species under the order Psitacciformes became representative of the \u201cNew World\u201d as a whole,\n    the place where East and West meet.</p>\n<p>Because the Americas were originally considered by Europeans to be a continuation of Asia around the other side of\n    the world, it was logical to place Eden, in the farthest East: in the Americas. The first known use of a parrot in a\n    Temptation scene is Albrecht D\xfcrer\u2019s 1504 <i><a\n            href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/the-fall-of-man-adam-and-eve/iQHbY2Sl7lrL0A" target="_blank">Adam and Eve</a></i>\n    <i> </i>engraving.<a href="#_lipsman_edn21"\n                         name="_lipsman_ednref21"\n                         title=""><sup>[21]</sup></a> Erwin Panofsky\u2019s analysis of the bird above Adam suggests that its presence\n    is meant to offset the evil of the serpent behind Eve. This is consistent with pre-Columbian associations between\n    parrots and the purity of virginity. The long tail on D\xfcrer\u2019s parrot indicates an American species. D\xfcrer had three\n    parrots in his household: his wife had a small green one, likely to be an Indian bird, and he received one from\n    M\xe1laga.<a href="#_lipsman_edn22"\n              name="_lipsman_ednref22"\n              title=""><sup>[22]</sup></a> It is unclear if the third parrot was a second green one or a second from M\xe1laga but\n    it is reasonable to guess that it came as one in a pair. We do not know what species D\xfcrer\u2019s parrot was, but coming\n    from a city on the coast of Spain, it is likely that it was a macaw from the Americas. </p>\n<p>\xa0Though parrots became more common in Europe through trade, they maintained their status as exotic and representative\n    of the New World, that is, lands at the ends of the earth from Europe. Andrea del Sarto\u2019s <i><a\n            href="http://www.travelingintuscany.com/images/art/andreadelsarto/triumphofcaesar700.jpg" target="_blank">Triumph of\n        Caesar</a></i> employs multiple parrot species to depict this idea.<a href="#_lipsman_edn23"\n                                                                              name="_lipsman_ednref23"\n                                                                              title=""><sup>[23]</sup></a> Two of the parrot\n    types can be identified with confidence: the African Gray Parrots and Ring-Necked Parakeets inside the cage.

With the understanding that this 16<sup>th</sup>century painting depicts Caesar receiving tribute\n    from the farthest reaches of his empire, it would make more sense for the parrots to represent all directions in\n    which the species was found, rather than just the lands immediately to the south and east of\n    Europe.<a href="#_lipsman_edn25"\n              name="_lipsman_ednref25"\n              title=""><sup>[25]</sup></a> Though the Roman Empire did not reach all the way to the Americas, del Sarto\u2019s world\n    had just expanded to encompass new lands as the Roman world expanded with each successful conquest. The inclusion of\n    what we now know to be an American bird is also a reference to the newly extended reach of contemporary European\n    empires.</p>\n<p>\xa0Prior to the exploration of the New World, parrots signaled that a scene took place in either Paradise or a heavenly\n    realm. As the number of voyages increased between Europe and the Americas, a trade in exotic birds turned the parrot\n    into a multivalent symbol. They represented the Americas and the vastness of the globe. They also came to acquire\n    another meaning. Because parrots could be taught to imitate human speech, they were seen as a metaphor for the\n    artist\u2019s mimicry of life. Peter Paul Rubens played with these new meanings in addition to the bird\u2019s traditionally\n    religious meanings in his various depictions of parrots.

Because it was now understood that Eden was\n    not likely to be in the New World, parrots were not often used as a symbol of Eden.\xa0 They were, however, still a\n    species that could place a scene in a faraway place. Because Rubens adds the macaw to an existing composition, he is\n    amalgamating two artists\u2019 works in one painting.<a\n            href="#_lipsman_edn27"\n            name="_lipsman_ednref27"\n            title=""><sup>[27]</sup></a> Irma Jaffe proposes that between the old belief that Paradise was in the Americas and\n    the fact that Ruben\u2019s access to macaws was a likely result of painting this work in Spain, the parrot may also refer\n    to Spanish holdings in America. Rubens would have seen Titian\u2019s original <i>Adam and Eve</i> in the Spanish Royal\n    collections, where it resided at the time. The parrot is a nod to the traditional interpretations of parrots in art,\n    a double reference to Titian and D\xfcrer , and an allusion to the power and reach of the Spanish throne. </p>\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0The <i>Adam and Eve</i> was not the first time Rubens had included a parrot in a religious scene. His\n    1613-1615 work, <i><a\n            href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/the-holy-family-with-the-parrot/ogEkvf1C1th7Rg" target="_blank">The Holy\n        Family with a Parrot</a></i> includes a Blue and Yellow Macaw perched on a column base behind Christ.<a\n            href="#_lipsman_edn28"\n            name="_lipsman_ednref28"\n            title=""><sup>[28]</sup></a> The spatial relationship between Christ and the parrot is the same as that between Adam\n    and his respective bird. Both macaws rest on a surface just over the shoulder of the figure below them. In <i>Adam\n        and Eve</i>, the parrot passively watches the scene unfold.\xa0 In <i>The Holy Family with a Parrot</i>, it ignores\n    the family and turns its attention to the vine grasped in its beak. This scene goes back to the association of Mary\n    and Christ serving as the new Adam and Eve. Like van Eyck\u2019s <i>Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele , </i>the\n    parrot makes the viewer think of Eden and the original sin from which the mother and Son serve as redemption. </p>\n<p>Rubens\u2019 depiction of Mary, Joseph, and Christ is one of the few examples of the Virgin and Child with a parrot that\n    is not a copy or partial copy of van Eyck\u2019s work<i>.</i> The fact that it comes 200 years after van Eyck\u2019s painting\n    shows that a connection between parrots and religious imagery remains in some form. The link in Rubens\u2019s work may\n    simply be that the association of parrots with Christian themes has become traditional through repetition. With too\n    much diversity in its employment to constitute any one image type, the parrot becomes a motif of Adam and Eve and\n    the newer, redemptive pair, Mary and Christ. A multifaceted symbol in Rubens\u2019 <i>The Holy Family with a Parrot</i>,\n    the bird works with the Oriental rug folded up directly below it to place the scene somewhere outside of Europe.\xa0\n</p>\n<p>As Europeans developed a concept of America as separate from Asia, the parrot came to symbolize the Americas in the\n    west more than Asia in the east. This painting shows that the memory of parrots representing the East and the exotic\n    survived into the 17th century and reminds us of Europe\u2019s earlier association of America and Asia. By employing an\n    American bird in an Eastern scene, Rubens depicts parrot species as interchangeable with one another across a range\n    extending from America to Asia.<a href="#_lipsman_edn29"\n                                      name="_lipsman_ednref29"\n                                      title=""><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>\n<p>Bruce Boehrer points out that Rubens paints parrots as both objects in a scene and as their own living beings. This\n    is evident in the number of paintings that show different parrot species, including a portrait of a Scarlet Macaw\n    from the 1630\u2019s simply titled <i><a\n            href="http://www.artandarchitecture.org.uk/images/gallery/d8488ed8.html" target="_blank">Parrot</a></i> <i>.<a\n            href="#_lipsman_edn30"\n            name="_lipsman_ednref30"\n            title=""> <b><sup>[30]</sup></b> </a></i> In this painting, the carefully rendered bird is the only living thing.\n    Like many subjects of human portraits, it sits very still. A mountainous landscape stretches out behind it. At this\n    point in history, the landscape may represent Europe instead of the parrot\u2019s native territory. </p>\n<p>By the 1520\u2019s, parrots had become so popular in Spain that explorers no longer felt the need to include them in their\n    listings of American species. When writing about the animals of the \u201cNew World\u201d in 1526, Gonz\xe1lo Fernandez de Oviedo\n    does not mention parrots at all. He glosses over their exclusion by explaining that it is a waste of time and\n    writing space to discuss species that are already readily available in Spain.<a\n            href="#_lipsman_edn31"\n            name="_lipsman_ednref31"\n            title=""><sup>[31]</sup></a> There is archaeological evidence to support this widespread trade in exotic birds. Two\n    parrot bones dated to the 17<sup>th</sup>century were found at Norwich\u2019s Castle Mall, which was certainly not a hub\n    of cosmopolitan activity at the time. <a\n            href="#_lipsman_edn32"\n            name="_lipsman_ednref32"\n            title=""><sup>[32]</sup></a> The number of macaw species represented by Rubens and the increasing representations of\n    parrots through the 17<sup>th</sup>century are both indicators of the booming market for exotic birds.</p>\n<p>The parrot trade developed hybrid species of macaws. In Ruben\u2019s 1635 <i><a\n        href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/rubens-his-wife-helena-fourment-1614%E2%80%931673-and-their-son-frans-1633%E2%80%931678/xgFC_TOdAAR2nQ" target="_blank">Rubens,\n    His wife Helena Fourment , and Their Son Frans</a></i> , we find another one of his macaws. This one, however, is\n    not as easily identified as the ones examined thus far.<a\n            href="#_lipsman_edn33"\n            name="_lipsman_ednref33"\n            title=""><sup>[33]</sup></a> This bird appears to be a hybrid species, a phenomenon that is not known to occur in the\n    wild. Today, the crossbreed is known as a Harlequin Macaw, resulting from a pairing of a Red and Green Macaw with a\n    Blue and Gold Macaw.<a href="#_lipsman_edn34"\n                           name="_lipsman_ednref34"\n                           title=""><sup>[34]</sup></a> The presence of this bird in a 17<sup>th</sup>century painting can mean\n    one of two things. The first, is that a male and female of the species in question were simply kept in a cage\n    together and happened to mate. The second possibility is that the hybrid was bred intentionally. It is impossible to\n    know how exactly this particular bird came to be, but both situations would be the direct result of the parrot trade\n    and the unnatural groupings in which the birds were kept. Surely once bird merchants were aware that macaws of\n    different subspecies could breed with one another to create unique color patterns, they would begin to use this to\n    increase their birds sales. Being a family portrait, the inclusion of a bird with out-of-the-ordinary parentage can\n    be read as a reference to procreation. If the bird was bred intentionally, it may also be a reference to the careful\n    selection of a spouse and subsequent courtship its human contemporaries practiced. </p>\n<p>By examining parrots, we see how Europeans assimilated the new variety of birds into their existing notions of\n    Paradise and the associated iconography. As they explored the region and better understood its geography, parrots\n    came to symbolize the Americas and the expansion of Europe\u2019s interactivity with the world. Finally, parrots came to\n    gain their own meaning to Europeans, independent of their Amerasian origins. Boehrer notes how the increasing\n    appearance of parrots in still lives through the 17<sup>th</sup>century demonstrates their fall in status. Prior to\n    1492, they had served as angelic messengers to men but by the 1600s they had become traded commodities. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Works Cited</h3>\n<p> Boehrer , Bruce Thomas. <i>Parrot Culture: Our 2,500-Year-Long Fascination with the World\u2019s Most Talkative Bird.</i>\n    Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2010.

The monkeys in this painting are unidentified, but their locations within\n    the overall composition are worth noting. A blonde white-faced monkey rides on a man\u2019s shoulders just left of the\n    painting\u2019s center as they ascend the stairs. A white- and red-haired, black-faced monkey sits on the steps to the\n    right, across an empty space left in just below the middle of the fresco. They seem to look at each other. The\n    black-faced monkey is dressed in a tunic while the blonde one is naked. They appear to be intentionally opposed to\n    one another. George argues that Europeans would have understood that the \u201cNew World\u201d monkeys of America were\n    different from the \u201cOld World\u201d monkeys they were familiar with in Asia and Africa (the terms New World and Old World\n    are used here as the taxonomic designations set by the scientific community). A key morphological and behavioral\n    difference between the monkeys of these regions becomes obvious after observation. New World monkeys have prehensile\n    tails that they use to climb and grasp while Old World monkeys do not. Neither of the monkeys in this painting use\n    their tails, but the contrast of clothed and nudity in conjunction with the space left between them leads me to\n    believe that they are meant to represent the distance between what was familiar to Europe and what was new to them.\n    George, <i>Animals and Maps</i>, 201.</p>\n\n<p><a href="#_lipsman_ednref26"\n      name="_lipsman_edn26"\n      title=""><sup>[26]</sup></a> Peter Paul Rubens, <i>Adam and Eve, </i>1628, oil on canvas, 237x184cm, Museo Nacional del\n    Prado, Madrid.

Claudius Ptolemy had supplied some of these, and others were\n    supplied by his commentator Johannes Werner. Indeed, I took note that Claudius Ptolemy had taught that the ratio of\n    the whole latitude to the whole longitude must be maintained not only in the parallel which should be drawn through\n    Rhodes or Thule, but clearly in all of them. Knowing this ratio, a great deal of related things that had previously\n    been obscure became clear to me, and this specification was among them. Once I had produced copious examples for\n    friends, they urged me,&nbsp;almost daily, to publish them and to promise that I would not hesitate to gratify their\n    wishes, should more certain information about the westerly lands reach me. As the unconquerable Charles the Fifth,\n    Emperor of Rome, forever Augustus, was returning to Cologne, I was wisely striking up a friendship with the\n    Castilians well-known for their substantial expertise, who among others were reporting that Baccalaria, Florida, New\n    Spain, and America have boundaries joined with the eastern edges in this hemisphere. Moreover, none of these\n    [Castilians] were able to speak soundly about the matter except for the Emperor, to whom day in and day out they\n    sent back stories from New Spain, speaking in this way about newly discovered scattered islands.\n</p>\n<p> Sed deinc [<i>sic</i>] cogita <i> n </i> ti q <i> uo </i> d ac/cidit (na<i>m</i> co <i> n </i> stituera <i> m </i>\n    quoq<i>ue</i> Cesarea <i> m </i> Maiestate <i> m </i> ea de re co<i>n</i> uenire) En C \u0119sarea<i>m</i> maiestate <i>\n        m </i> co <i> n </i> ueni uera inda/gando ubi, me <i> n </i> tio fuerat facta de illis terris modo dictis inter\n    alia C \u0119sarea maiestas respo<i>n</i>sione <i> m </i> dedit Ter/ras prenominatas minime e <i> ss </i> e deremptas\n    [<i>sic</i>] maris interstitio, sed orie<i>n</i>talibus a<i>n</i> nexas.

He continued, saying\n    that earlier the Spaniards had again and again gone west exploring from Tenochtitlan, the famous city of the Great\n    Khan, also called Montezuma, and had not been able to find for him an end to the huge land. This would be sufficient\n    proof that the western country reaches to the Chinese region and to the people of China, and make it certain that\n    they belong in the sphere of the Castilians. This information he had received from Indians who had fought in wars\n    with the unconquerable Ferdinand Cortes in New Spain. </p>\n<p>I would have quoted more of this statement here, but not for the fact that the book on Cosmography will have a\n    passage about such things when it is eventually brought out, everything, therefore dear reader, that was\n    communicated to me by his Imperial Majesty, and I wish for it to be communicated to you as it was spoken thus.\xa0 I\n    offer this upon my arms, and in the meantime it will be of use to you, as you receive it from the mind that was my\n    own source.

For many years this man, the commander of the ships of Portugal,\n    had traversed the shores of the entire East, and, having crossed the limits of Portuguese territories, he had made\n    trade with the peoples of China, who\u2014he was demonstrating and reporting\u2014belonged to the territory of the Castilians.\n    On account of these injustices inflicted upon him by the king of Portugal, he retreated into Castile. By far the\n    most certain conclusion to be inferred is that it is to be believed that the Moluccas, filled with types of every\n    spice, are contained within the limits of the Castilians. The Unconquerable Caesar provided a fleet of five ships,\n    and Magellan was placed in command as the leader of these. Then, Magellan set sail with the five ships from Seville\n    on August 10, 1519, and within a few days arrived at the Fortunate Isles [the Canaries, see on map \u201cFORTUNAta\n    insulae \u201d]. From there, to the Hesperides [Cape Verde, see on map \u201cHesperidum insulae \u201d], from which they began\n    their journey to America, [where] they discovered a promontory, the name for which is Santa Maria [see on map \u201cC. S.\n    Mariae promontorio dive virginis \u201d]. From there, at the end of March of the following year, they were carried down\n    to the port of Saint Julian [on map \u201cP. Iuliani\u201d], where they were suffering an especially bitter winter in May; and\n    indeed, now in our summer, there one must suffer winter. From there, setting sail again on August 24, they arrived\n    at the Province of the Cross on November 26 [see map, \u201cC. Crucis\u201d]. When that place had been abandoned and the\n    narrow sea crossed, they came to the Unfortunate Isles [see map, just north of the Tropic of Capricorn \u201cInsule\n    infortunatae \u201d]. Then, after four months, they came to Inuagana [on map, near the figure of Magellan, \u201cInuagana\u201d],\n    and from there to the Moluccas [on map, just north of the equator, \u201cMoluccae insulae \u201d], where they loaded the ships\n    with cloves. Then, when the Spaniards had set sail from Tidore [on map, \u201cMare Theodore \u201d] through the deep Indian\n    Ocean, giving their sails to the wind once they had navigated past the Cape of Good Hope, they arrived again in\n    Spain on September 6, 1522, at the nearby port of Seville.</p>"},252:function(e,n){e.exports="<h1>Cartouche on America/Vespucci: Transcription and Translation</h1>\n<h2>Transcription and translation: Michael Agnew and Gabrielle Roehr</h2>\n<p>America quam Americus Vesputius Nouum orbem Continentem quam/ terram nuncupauit, ab Americo Vesputio eiusdem\n    inuentore nomen for-/tita Castellani uero modo Terram firmam uocant, &amp; ob id non immeri-/to nunc Quarta pars\n    terr\u0119 dicta is ultra \u0119quatorem, ubi conspicatus gen-/tem mores, humanitatem, soli feracitatem, aeris temperiem,\n    salubrita-/temque coeli; nactum se esse testatur cultiores regiones, easdemque habi-/tatoribus frequentiores, quam\n    alibi gentium usquam, si Asiam, si Euro-/pam, Africamque spectaueris &amp;c<i>etera</i>.

The\n    story, written as an audience between More and fellow real-life humanist Peter Giles and fictional character Raphael\n    Hythlodaeus, blends fact and fiction, satire and sermon, to create an account that coyly straddles the boundaries\n    between plausible testimony, absurd fantasy, and moral manifesto. Organized into a two-book structure, Hythlodaeus\n    first expounds on a critique of the inequity of European\u2013predominantly English\u2013society, and then offers a\n    description of the island commonwealth of Utopia as a moralizing counterexample. According to his account, after\n    staying behind with a contingent from Amerigo Vespucci\u2019s fourth voyage in the New World and traveling westward\n    through diversely peopled lands, Hythlodaeus came upon Utopia, an island society with a sophisticated political,\n    economic, and social system based around communitarian principles: property in common, a disdain for gold and\n    precious stones, religious tolerance, pacifism; equal distribution of labor, and a strict penal system. First\n    published in 1516, <i>Utopia\u2019</i>s New World setting has been the subject of scrutiny as centuries of Morean\n    scholars have attempted to untangle its course among the many philosophical threads woven into this improbable tale.\n</p>\n<p>While the references, both direct and indirect, to the details of Vespucci\u2019s letters are clear in the text, there has\n    nonetheless been much debate about the extent to which accounts of transatlantic exploration shaped the overall\n    content and motifs of <i>Utopia. </i>One argument is that More\u2019s vision of a peaceful, orderly commonwealth is far\n    too estranged from Vespucci\u2019s description of naked, uncouth, and sometimes violent New World natives, and so this\n    inspiration must have been incidental at best.<a href="#_edn1"\n                                                     name="_ednref1"\n                                                     title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> Alternatively, many scholars note that\n    a clear emphasis on Greek culture and philosophy points to ancient authors such as Plato, Homer, and Lucian as\n    More\u2019s primary influences, rather than any contemporary writing.<a href="#_edn2"\n                                                                       name="_ednref2"\n                                                                       title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a> As a humanist, More\n    certainly strove to promote ancient philosophy as a guiding principle for scholarly thought and rhetoric, and his\n    circle particularly privileged Greek writing and philosophy over Roman.<a href="#_edn3"\n                                                                              name="_ednref3"\n                                                                              title=""><sup>[3]</sup></a> More\u2019s friend\n    Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam was at the forefront of this push, publishing the first modern Greek translation of\n    the New Testament in the same year as More\u2019s <i>Utopia,</i><a href="#_edn4"\n                                                                  name="_ednref4"\n                                                                  title=""><sup>[4]</sup></a>and More himself was a\n    noted Greek and Latin scholar, better known for his translation of Lucian than the text of\n    <i>Utopia.</i><a href="#_edn5"\n                     name="_ednref5"\n                     title=""><sup>[5]</sup></a> However, these superficial incompatibilities with explorers\u2019 accounts\n    do not preclude the importance of the New World as both a physical and conceptual setting for the Utopians; rather,\n    More\u2019s text often dramatizes the ways in which accounts from the New World were fitted into existing paradigms of\n    geography and world history built on antique models. <i>Utopia </i>repeatedly reveals and develops these paradigms\n    while exploiting the shifting terrain of new geographical discoveries. </p>\n<p>Initially published in Leuven in Latin, several editions of <i>Utopia</i> were printed in More\u2019s lifetime accompanied\n    by a group of appendices that reinforced the false authenticity of Hythlodaeus\u2019s story. The text is introduced as a\n    true account related in person to More in the company of Peter Giles. Their mutual friend Erasmus helped gather\n    letters from accomplished scholars from their circle to preface the book along with a <a\n            href="https://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/.a/6a00d8341c464853ef01b7c863db20970b-popup"\n            target="_blank">map of the island </a>(the original designer of which is unknown) and a poem by the supposed\n    poet laureate of Utopia with a Utopian-to-Latin translation.

It begins with the Persia-adjacent\n    land of the Polylerlites, which Hythlodaeus cites in his Book One, and repeats in the language, history, and culture\n    of Utopia: though Utopian retains \u201ctraces of Greek\u201d, it \u201cresembles Persian in other respects.\u201d In discussing the\n    country\u2019s founder, Utopus, Hythlodaeus reveals that it was previously called \u201cAbraxa,\u201d<a href="#_edn35"\n                                                                                             name="_ednref35"\n                                                                                             title=""><sup>[35]</sup></a>\n    and he twice names \u201cMithra\u201d as the common name for god in an otherwise religiously heterogenous\n    society.<a href="#_edn36"\n               name="_ednref36"\n               title=""><sup>[36]</sup></a> Not only does Persia represent the Asian periphery of the ancient\n    Mediterranean world, but the invocation of gnosticism through Abraxas and the esoteric spiritual traditions of\n    Mithraism proposes a society with a similar origin to Latin West, but several steps removed in its expression. Just\n    as gnosticism straddles a nebulous line between the Christian and the Pagan, the Utopians are both familiar and\n    foreign, occupying a physical space that is just over the horizons, known but not seen, both east and west\n    simultaneously.</p>\n<p>The emphasis on Greek culture over any other antique identity speaks to a divide in humanistic circles that pitted\n    the philosophy of Greece against that of Rome, seeing them as two fundamentally incompatible and opposing\n    philosophies, rather than a concatenating progression in human thought.<a href="#_edn37"\n                                                                              name="_ednref37"\n                                                                              title=""><sup>[37]</sup></a> In the midst\n    of this culture war, the New World came to act as a mirror of whichever antique virtues or vices lent credence to a\n    chosen intellectual or political polemic, and vice versa. In an anonymous 1541 tract entitled <i>La Pazzia </i>(\u201cFolly\u201d),\n    which both in title and content echoed the anti-Ciceronian argument of Erasmus\u2019s <i>In Praise of Folly</i>, the\n    author\u2013 sometimes thought to be the translator of the first Italian vernacular edition of <i>Utopia, </i>Ortensio\n    Landi<a href="#_edn38"\n            name="_ednref38"\n            title=""><sup>[38]</sup></a>\u2013 appears to follow More\u2019s lead in idealizing the Epicurean qualities of New\n    World natives, stating romantically,</p>\n<p>\u201cHow happy people would be without these so-called wise men [the \u201cwisdom\u201d of Ciceronian\n    <i>patria </i>and <i>gloria</i>] can easily be judged from the life and customs of the newly-discovered peoples of\n    the West-Indies\u2026[They] are happy without laws, without letters, without so-called wise men; they don\u2019t value gold or\n    jewels; they don\u2019t know avarice, or ambition\u2026 they are nourished by what the ground produces without any\n    cultivation\u2026 as in the Republic of Plato, everything is in common\u2026 they live in perpetual love and grace, just as in\n    that fortunate and truly golden age of Saturn in ancient times.\u201d<a\n            href="#_edn39"\n            name="_ednref39"\n            title=""><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>\n<p>However, in the case of Oviedo\'s<i> Historia, </i>this innocence is stripped to expose the immorality of natives\u2019\n    marital and sexual practices, cannibalism, and murder: \u201cidolatr\xedas y errores\u201d that echo the paganism of antiquity in\n    a \u201creligion of the Devil.\u201d<a href="#_edn40"\n                                 name="_ednref40"\n                                 title=""><sup>[40]</sup></a> Oviedo\u2019s objectives in drawing these parallels differ\n    vastly from the anonymous author of <i>La Pazzia </i>and from More; he deploys a number of strategies for\n    determining the origins of the New World that justify Spanish conquest.

In what may be the only contemporary artistic reference to <i>Utopia</i> beyond the illustrations of\n    the first and second editions, a curious print indicates the conflicting characterizations of the New World using\n    <i>Utopia</i> as a pretext. The panoramic scene depicts a bloody battle between clothed and nearly naked men beneath\n    the towering branches of a pine forest. The nude men have neither exoticizing costume beyond their nakedness nor\n    distinctly non-European morphology, and in a <a\n            href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/404505"\n            target="_blank">first state print of the woodcut</a> in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in\n    New York, the only clearly identifying information is the woodcutter\u2019s mark. In a second state exhibited in Leuven\n    in 2016, however, a poem has been added beneath the image that identifies the nude men as hailing from Utopia, \u2018not\n    far from Morian\u2019:</p>\n<p style="margin: 8%"> Ain Insel hai\xdft Utopion / Die leyt nit ferr von Morian<br> Dag[e]schach ain sollichs schlagen /\n    Hundert tausent hort ich sagen <br>Doch ist es eben vil der Jar / Das ich gelaub es sey nit war<br> Wann wie wolt\n    ain nackend man / Ain angelegten pawren b[e]stan\u2026<a\n            href="#_edn41"\n            name="_ednref41"\n            title=""><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>\n<p>Perhaps the woodcutter is making an early reference to Morpion, a land later cited as existing a quarter league from\n    the Rio de la Plata by Andr\xe9 Thevet in his travel account <i>Les singularitez de la France antarctique</i><i> </i>(The\n    New Found World, or Antarctike).

In any case, his connection to the text of <i>Utopia</i> is not\n    arbitrary. Hans L\xfctzelberger, identified by his monogram, was employed by More\u2019s Basel publisher Johann Froben, and\n    worked with Hans Holbein the Younger, brother of More\u2019s 1518 illustrator Ambrosius Holbein in illustrating\n    Reformation bibles and humanist tracts.<a\n            href="#_edn43"\n            name="_ednref43"\n            title=""><sup>[43]</sup></a> He may have been intimately familiar with the Utopian narrative and other\n    travel accounts through these associations. The choice to associate More\u2019s sophisticated, peaceful Utopians with\n    naked, warlike drunkards (a figure at the far left curiously holds a beer tankard) speaks to the text\u2019s involvement\n    in an ongoing dialogue between reports of the New World and the paradigms projected onto it by the curious\n    intellectual circles of Europe. Where More projected the virtues of Platonic and Epicurean antiquity onto New World\n    natives, here we see something more akin to Oviedo\u2019s \u201cidolotr\xedas\u201d projected back onto Utopia. But even this poem\n    remains ambiguous, calling into question the veracity of eyewitnesses to the Utopian battle: \u201cHundert tausent hort\n    ich sagen / Doch ist es eben vil der Jar / Das ich gelaub es sey nit war\u201d states (in rough translation) that though\n    \u201ca hundred thousand heard [the story] told / it was many years ago / I don\u2019t believe it happened.\u201d<a href="#_edn44"\n                                                                                                         name="_ednref44"\n                                                                                                         title=""><sup>[44]</sup></a>\n</p>\n<p>Michel Foucault tells us that \u201cUtopias are sites with no real place.

But <i>Utopia </i>problematizes\n    place and space in an inherently different way. More\u2019s utopia is full of improbable ideals and radical notions like\n    any other, some that are shockingly revolutionary even to a 21st century reader. But the space it occupies, though\n    unresolved, is real: the New World. This New World is not truly new; it is merely the unseen reaches of the Old\n    World that have long existed over the horizon, now beginning to come into view. While his primary intention may be\n    to promote the virtues of a society modeled on Greek philosophy rather than to discern the identity of new lands or\n    attempt an anthropological portrait, the setting is key to rendering its improbability believable, appropriating the\n    New World\u2019s inherent geographical, topological, and cultural mutability, already rich in contradiction and\n    fantastical detail. He utilizes this manifold imaginary to disguise the fictitiousness of Hythlodaeus\u2019s account. The\n    physical distance of America and the temporal distance of antiquity become analogous to one another, just as the\n    north/south axis of the known-to-unknown becomes interchangeable with the axis of east to west and the Elysian\n    fields converge with India; Hythlodaeus himself becomes an analogue for Ulysses and Vespucci simultaneously. Rather\n    than occupying a \u201cfundamentally unreal space,\u201d Utopia occupies a real space that simply has yet to be defined in\n    fixed terms and so can realistically be all things at once. Unlike the utopias of Foucault, this space is not a\n    passive mirror. It has its own evolving identity that reflects back, changing and influencing those working to\n    define it. </p>\n<hr>\n<div id=edn1>\n    <p><a href="#_ednref1"\n          name="_edn1"\n          title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> Cave, Alfred A., \u201cThomas More and the New World,\u201d <i>Albion: A Quarterly Journal\n        Concerned with British Studies </i>23, No. 2 (Summer, 1991): 211-212.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=edn2>\n    <p><a href="#_ednref2"\n          name="_edn2"\n          title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a> Raisch, Jane, \u201cHumanism and Hellenism: Lucian and the Afterlives of Greek in\n        More\u2019s Utopia\u201d, <i>ELH</i> 83, No. 4 (Winter 2016): 928-929.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=edn3>\n    <p><a href="#_ednref3"\n          name="_edn3"\n          title=""><sup>[3]</sup></a>Nelson, Eric, \u201cUtopia through Italian Eyes: Thomas More and the Critics of Civic\n        Humanism\u201d, <i>Renaissance Quarterly</i> 59, No. 4 (Winter 2006): 1034.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=edn4>\n    <p><a href="#_ednref4"\n          name="_edn4"\n          title=""><i><sup><b>[4]</b></sup></i></a>Price, David H., \u201cHans Holbein the Younger and Reformation Bible\n        Production,\u201d <i>Church History</i> 86, no. 4 (Dec. 2017): 999; 1002.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=edn5>\n    <p><a href="#_ednref5"\n          name="_edn5"\n          title=""><i><sup><b>[5]</b></sup></i></a>Raisch, Jane, \u201cHumanism and Hellenism\u201d, 933.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=edn6>\n    <p><a href="#_ednref6"\n          name="_edn6"\n          title=""><sup>[6]</sup></a> Du Verger, Jean, \u201cG\xe9ographie et Cartographie Fictionelles dans l\u2019<i>Utopie </i>(1516)\n        de Thomas More\u201d, <i>Moreana</i> 47, no. 181-182, 9-68 and Lester, Toby, <i>The Fourth Part of the World: The\n            Race to the Ends of the Earth and the Epic Story of the Map That Gave America its Name,</i> (London: Free\n        Press, 2009) 377. </p>\n</div>\n<div id=edn7>\n    <p><a href="#_ednref7"\n          name="_edn7"\n          title=""><sup>[7]</sup></a> Vespucci, Amerigo, \u201cLetter to Piero Soderini\u201d in <i>Letters from a New World:\n        Amerigo Vespucci\u2019s Discovery of America</i>, ed.

Here Amerigen becomes A-meri-gen, or \u201cNo-place-land\u201d: not a bad way to\n        describe a previously unnamed continent whose geography is still uncertain,\u201d and when commenting on the <i>Cosmographiae\u2019</i>s\n        influence on More on page 377, he observes, \u201cThe name Utopia itself- a word coined by More from Greek roots to\n        mean \u201cno-place\u201d (ou-topia), \u201cgood place\u201d (eu-topia), or both- bears an uncanny likeness to the name America.\n        Both are three-syllable coinages derived from Greek, both identify a previously unknown region across the ocean\n        and suggest it may be a kind of Nowhere Land (A-meri-gen, or \u201cno-place-land,\u201d and ou-topia or \u201cno-place\u201d), and\n        both involve a private play on words intended for a small audience of highly educated humanists.\u201d </p>\n</div>\n<div id=edn18>\n    <p><a href="#_ednref18"\n          name="_edn18"\n          title=""><sup>[18]</sup></a> Vespucci, Amerigo, \u201cLetter VI to Piero Soderini (Quattro Viaggio)\u201d in <i>Letters\n        from a New World: Amerigo Vespucci\u2019s Discovery of America</i>, ed.

Francesco\u2019s brother, Ferdinando I,\n    who succeeded him as Duke of Tuscany, rushed to decorate the armory before his wedding to Christina of Lorraine. The\n    room contained weapons and armor from around the world, including the New World and India, acquired by Francesco, an\n    avid collector.<a href="#_weitzman_edn1"\n                      name="_weitzman_ednref1"\n                      title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> In 1588, Medici court artist Ludovico Buti completed frescoes on the\n    armory\u2019s ceiling depicting four international battle scenes to accompany the weapons on display, now gallery room 20\n    in the Uffizi in Florence (<i>figure 1, 2</i>). The grotesque tracery design was common during this period,\n    particularly for armory ceilings, but in this case bolsters the fantastic forms of New World\n    discoveries.<a href="#_weitzman_edn2"\n                   name="_weitzman_ednref2"\n                   title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a> Although exceedingly wealthy, the Medici did not have the financial\n    wherewithal to fund their own New World expeditions. Because the room displayed the Medici arms collection and was\n    considered a social space, it is likely that Ferdinando, as the new Duke, intended to utilize the room to project\n    his family\u2019s wealth and power to the wedding guests and other dignitaries. Ludovico Buti served these needs by\n    presenting an amalgamation of New World cultures and conquests by utilizing prints, maps, and texts circulating\n    within the Medici cultural milieu. While current scholarship has demonstrated that there are clear political agendas\n    addressed in the armory\u2019s imagery which align the family with Spain and Portugal, I argue that Buti\u2019s intermix of\n    disparate cultures also reveals the Medici considered New World objects to be only loosely separate from the Asian\n    continent during the late Cinquecento. By interlacing the New World with India, the armory\u2019s imagery reveals a court\n    culture in which the definition of the Americas was still in flux. As such, the fresco reflects Francesco\u2019s desire\n    to have agency in New World discoveries, while simultaneously revealing a broader resistance to modifying the\n    continent\u2019s Ptolemaic, and thus anachronistic, connection to Asia.\xa0 </p>\n<p>The armory\u2019s four battle scenes fan out from the center of the ceiling and depict conflicts between Western European\n    armies and natives from America, Africa, and Asia. The scenes to the ceiling\u2019s north and south feature imagery with\n    clear cultural signifiers and some indication of geography, although it is not totally conclusive, whereas the east\n    and west scenes are less straightforward. The battle located to the north (<i>figure 3</i>) depicts the Medici, as\n    signified by the <i>palle</i> banner paraded on horseback, defeating the Turks in striped turbans who clamor up the\n    side of a hill after dropping their crescent moon flag. The background is less clear as a nondescript maritime\n    setting, which could depict the battle of Piombino, a crucial trade port developed by Ferdinando.<a href="#_weitzman_edn3"\n                                                                                                        name="_weitzman_ednref3"\n                                                                                                        title=""><sup>[3]</sup></a>\n    Directly below the scene is a marginal rectangular gold box with tracery design containing two elephants and spiky\n    palms. The opposite battle on the southern side of the ceiling (<i>figure 4</i>) could be a clash between the\n    Spanish, as signified by the red and white standard,<a href="#_weitzman_edn4"\n                                                           name="_weitzman_ednref4"\n                                                           title=""><sup>[4]</sup></a> and New World feathered natives,\n    who defend themselves with spears and shields against the far superior European guns.<a href="#_weitzman_edn5"\n                                                                                            name="_weitzman_ednref5"\n                                                                                            title=""><sup>[5]</sup></a>\n    The background is dotted with tropical foliage and arched huts cascading along rolling hills, and another small\n    rectangular box is positioned below the scene containing a native standing contrapposto with a rhinoceros. </p>\n<p>The scenes on the east and west ends of the ceiling are less detailed and more difficult to identify. Lia Markey\n    argues the skin color, dress, and weaponry of the natives are evidence that the two scenes are battles between Turks\n    and Africans (<i>figure 5</i>), and Islamic North Africa and the Portuguese (<i>figure 6</i>).<a href="#_weitzman_edn6"\n                                                                                                     name="_weitzman_ednref6"\n                                                                                                     title=""><sup>[6]</sup></a>\n    The Turks in the lower left corner of the African scene are identifiable based on their striped clothing and\n    turbans. However, the identity of their opponents is not decidedly African. Given the figures are wearing loin\n    cloths and carrying bows and swords, and the setting is mountainous and hilly, with tropical foliage containing low\n    huts featured in Buti\u2019s American battle between the Spanish, the sense of place is muddied and could also be\n    identified as a New World setting. The battle between Islamic North Africa and the Portuguese is similarly\n    convoluted. </p>\n<p>The central <i>tondo </i>(<i>figure 7</i>) unites the four battle scenes and acts as a sharp foil to their frenetic\n    energy and violence. It is idyllic, with tropical foliage and a hint of architecture in the background, devoid of\n    both war and European figures. In the foreground, seven men wearing striped loin cloths and full feathered\n    headdresses, carrying arrows and a parasol, parade a cloaked regal figure across the edge of the frame. The \u201cchief\u201d\n    carries what appears to be a type of battle axe, which was likely similar to one on view in the armory. The parade\n    of natives is a spectacle of mannered and classicizing poses, weapons, and display of exotica, which Peter Mason\n    considers a hybrid assemblage of motifs that has moved away from ethnographic accuracy.<a href="#_weitzman_edn7"\n                                                                                              name="_weitzman_ednref7"\n                                                                                              title=""><sup>[7]</sup></a>\n    The headdressed natives set in an architectural tropical landscape are congruent with the inexact exotica in rest of\n    the scenes. Who, and where, are these natives?</p>\n<p>The ambiguous geographic locations and fluidity of iconographic signifiers in all four battle scenes bring to bear\n    the scholarly problem of discerning how the Medici defined America and its natives, landmasses, and objects. The\n    conflated idea of \u201cAmerasia,\u201d a term that refers to the amalgamation of America and Asia in sixteenth-century maps,\n    imagery, and texts, is a problem circulating through current scholarly arguments with no resolution. In the case of\n    Buti\u2019s armory fresco, Amerasian imagery is present in the battle between the Medici and American natives,\n    particularly in the rhinoceros below, and the central <i>tondo</i> in which architectural details, flora, and native\n    dress blur demarcation between New World Americas and broadly southern Asian signifiers such as bananas,<a\n            href="#_weitzman_edn8"\n            name="_weitzman_ednref8"\n            title=""><sup>[8]</sup></a> a parasol, and the chief\u2019s bier (a trope that will be examined later through\n    circulating prints). In her seminal 2015 book <i>Imagining the Americas in Medici Florence</i>, Lia Markey argues\n    that by using cultural generalizations to contextualize Medici weaponry, Buti\u2019s ceiling is a theatrical performance\n    of foreign natives whose ethnographic rendering was intended to demonstrate the weapons in use while also\n    politically aligning the Medici with New World discoveries.<a href="#_weitzman_edn9"\n                                                                  name="_weitzman_ednref9"\n                                                                  title=""><sup>[9]</sup></a> Ultimately, Markey argues\n    that Ferdinando was responding to Philip II, King of Spain, Portugal, and Sicily, who banned Amerasian imagery\n    because of its blasphemous content. Ferdinando was careful not to undermine Philip\u2019s desires because the Medici\n    depended on Spain\u2019s financial partnership.<a\n            href="#_weitzman_edn10"\n            name="_weitzman_ednref10"\n            title=""><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>\n<p>However, with the problem of Amerasia in mind, additional connotations emerge from the frescoes\u2019 details when\n    considering contemporary costume books, texts, and maps that would have been familiar to the Medici court. Although\n    the Medici likely viewed these lands as separate continents and conquests, they might also have conceptualized\n    America and Asia as a region of the world where the East met the West. Thus, in utilizing ubiquitous reference\n    materials present within the Medici milieu, the contemporary viewer might have understood the multifarious\n    signifiers in Buti\u2019s imagery as depicting a New World in close concert with India and Southeast Asia, as well as the\n    Medici alignment to these conquests through collections and political alliances displayed prominently in the armory.\n    There is little scholarship outside of Markey\u2019s work that considers the social implications of Buti\u2019s fresco. In\n    addition to its theatricality and political implications, Buti\u2019s iconography has an ideological demarcation that is\n    worth investigating. </p>\n<p>At the intersection of Asian and New World iconography are ethnographic composites of disparate New World cultures.\n    The mixing of New World societies through objects and depictions of its natives, particularly Aztec and Brazilian in\n    this case, should be examined at the outset, because the larger issue of cultural overlap between Asia and New World\n    imagery is partly rooted in an unclear definition of the word \u201cIndian.\u201d<b> </b>In 1588, when Ferdinando assumed\n    responsibility for completing the armory decoration, the definition of terms such as \u201cNew World\u201d and \u201cIndian\u201d were\n    still decidedly fluid; \u201cNew World\u201d could refer to newly discovered lands of both the east and west. (On the range of meanings of the word India and Indians, <a\n            href="/riccio-india">see the\n    entry by Vittoria Riccio</a>.) Ferdinando\u2019s\n    collection inventories from c.1571 to 1588 use the terms <i>Indiana</i>, <i>alla\n    Indiana</i>, and <i>dell</i><i>\u2019</i><i>Indie </i>to\n    define objects from the Americas, India, of Moorish origin, and Asia more\n    generally.<a href="#_weitzman_edn11"\n                 name="_weitzman_ednref11"\n                 title=""><sup>[11]</sup></a> The\n    word \u201cIndian\u201d itself is loaded and imprecise.

The fixation on Vespucci and his alignment with the discovery of the New\n    World is still evident in the creation of images like Stradano\u2019s, and indicates a pervasive ideological attachment\n    to his conquests.<a href="#_weitzman_edn21"\n                        name="_weitzman_ednref21"\n                        title=""><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>\n<p>The full-plumed headdresses on Buti\u2019s natives could be a quotation of Stradano\u2019s allegory given their visual\n    congruence, but, in turn, also a reference to Vespucci\u2019s textual accounts of America.

Rather, while Brazilian iconography prevails in Buti\u2019s\n    Amerindian imagery as demonstrated by his quotation of Weiditz, as well as visual connections to Stradano\u2019s courtly\n    work and Vespucci\u2019s Florentine legacy, Asian references in Ludovico Buti\u2019s imagery are equally prevalent and\n    significant. One probable connection to the Asian continent in Ludovico Buti\u2019s armory ceiling is the convincingly\n    rendered rhinoceros below the battle scene between New World natives and Spanish conquistadors (<i>figure 11</i>).\n    The inclusion of the rhinoceros is not perfunctory. Buti also positions two elephants below the opposite Medici\n    scene; because the Turks often used elephants in battle, the iconography is fitting in this particular context.<a\n            href="#_weitzman_edn28"\n            name="_weitzman_ednref28"\n            title=""><sup>[28]</sup></a> With a clear cultural conjunction in the elephants, one can infer that the\n    rhinoceros carries a similar signification. </p>\n<p>The rhinoceros also appears in Francesco I de Medici\u2019s sixteenth-century fabricated grotto in the Garden of Castello\n    at the outskirts of Florence (<i>figure 12</i>). The menagerie of 36 animals include, among others, native European\n    fauna: an Indian elephant, rhinoceros, and goat, an African lion, giraffe, and camel, and a New World\n    turkey\u2014referred to as <i>gallina d\u2019 India </i>in inventories and the larger courtly milieu in Rome and Florence, and\n    often equated with the peacock (which could explain Stradano\u2019s peacock plumes on his allegory of\n    America).<a href="#_weitzman_edn29"\n                name="_weitzman_ednref29"\n                title=""><sup>[29]</sup></a> This composite reflects a similar approach to both Buti\u2019s imagery and\n    Medici cataloging of precious objects. This conflation of culture is mirrored by the liberal nature of cataloging by\n    terminology and categorization in Medici inventories c.1539 and 1564, which classified objects by type, such as\n    weapons, costumes, animals, and masks, rather than separating them by geographic region.<a\n            href="#_weitzman_edn30"\n            name="_weitzman_ednref30"\n            title=""><sup>[30]</sup></a> Further, according to Claudia Lazzaro, the Indian rhinoceros was rarely seen in\n    person, but Albrecht Durer\u2019s 1515 print (<i>figure 13</i>) made wide circulation and was most likely the model for\n    the grotto.<a\n            href="#_weitzman_edn31"\n            name="_weitzman_ednref31"\n            title=""><sup>[31]</sup></a> It is possible that the print stood in for Buti\u2019s rendering as well, forming a\n    clear association with India. Thus, the rhinoceros in its clear connection to the grotto, and the elephants and\n    their connection to the Turks, form a central line across the fresco that represents not only conquest but a New\n    World that overlaps with Indian cultural signifiers.\xa0 </p>\n<p>Imagery tied to India featuring New World natives was also present in circulating prints and atlases during Buti\u2019s\n    period. German painter and printmaker Hans Burgkmair\u2019s c.1526 print series <i>People of Calicut: The Triumphal\n        Procession of Emperor Maximilian I </i>(<i>figures 14, 15, 16</i>) features an interwoven group of disparate\n    figures.

To the\n    far right are two fat elephants roaming inland. That a feathered native and chief on a bier can be considered both\n    from America and Calicut/India, and elephants can be Turkish or Indian demonstrates the looser visual demarcation\n    regarding the New World as a geographic place still prevalent in Buti\u2019s period and fully adopted into Medici visual\n    culture.</p>\n<p>That Burgkmair and Braun/Hogenberg\u2019s depictions of Calicutians use similar iconographic tropes presented in Buti\u2019s\n    American natives could indicate confusion, a conflation of \u201cforeign,\u201d \u201cexotic,\u201d \u201cIndian,\u201d or \u201cNew World\u201d things. By\n    borrowing from multiple circulating prints and codices, Buti created adulterated images in the armory that likely\n    seemed familiar to the viewer but lacked specificity. Evidence that the Medici were slower to let go of cultural\n    consolidation and references to the Indies is also present in contemporary maps that were important cultural\n    artifacts. The Guardaroba (<i>figure 19</i>) was another colossal project spearheaded by the Medici family meant to\n    bring order to their collection of transcontinental objects through organizing objects by region, but was never\n    fully realized.

(On Cathay, Tangut, and Mangi on\n    sixteenth-century maps, <a\n            href="#wu-tangut-cathay-mangi">see the essay by Peiyue Wu</a>.)\n    Within the <i>Theatrum Orbis Terrarum </i>there is also a detailed map of the Pacific (<i>figure 21</i>), the first\n    of its kind. The Americas are positioned in close proximity to China, New Guinea, and Japan, leaving a Pacific Ocean\n    that is smaller than how we understand it today, underscoring the probability that the Medici and their\n    contemporaries did not completely divorce the Americas from the East. </p>\n<p>Ortelius\u2019s <i>Indiae Orientalis, </i>in the same atlas, (<i>figure 22</i>)<i> </i>reveals similar information to his\n    map of the Pacific. India and Southeast Asia are presented as a landmass without boundaries, in close proximity to\n    Japan, Papua New Guinea, and the Americas. The American continent is labelled in Latin as <i>Americae Siue\n        Indiae</i><i>\u2014</i>\u201cAmerica or India.\u201d The intimacy of the Americas and the East and its textual connection to\n    India mirrors Ludovico Buti\u2019s seemingly appropriative armory ceiling, and in this respect qualifies the logic in\n    commingling Indian signifiers with Brazil and Aztec in sixteenth-century pictorial representations. German\n    cartographer Caspar Vopel\u2019s c.1545 map <i>Nova Et Integra Vniversaliqve Orbis Totivs IVXTA Germanvm Neotericovm\n        Traditionem Descriptio</i> (copied in Venice c.1558) also joins New Spain with Asia. The Harvard c.1558 copy by\n    Vavassore is divided into 12 prints that make up a map of the world. In the top left section, <i>India\n        Orientalis </i>is merged with <i>Asia Magna, Messigo, </i>and <i>Hispania. </i>In the neighboring section to the\n    right, <i>Asia Orientalis </i>is just above <i>Hispania Major</i>. Further down the map in what appears to be modern\n    Mexico or South America is <i>America Nova Orbis Pars </i>(<i>figures 23, 24, 25, 26</i>)<i>.</i></p>\n<p>While Vopel\u2019s map did not originate in Italy, Florence was not divorced from the culture from which it emerged; as\n    demonstrated, prints from Germany, Antwerp, and across Europe played some role in developing the courtly worldview\n    of an America conjoined with, or closely related to, Asia.<a href="#_weitzman_edn41"\n                                                                 name="_weitzman_ednref41"\n                                                                 title=""><sup>[41]</sup></a> With this in mind, it is\n    likely the Medici and their artists understood the New World and its natives to be of the East and aligned more\n    closely ideologically with the expansive India Orient that in the Ptolemaic tradition lies \u201cbeyond the Ganges,\u201d or\n    as Columbus described during his second voyage in 1494, Alpha-Omega, where east meets west.<a href="#_weitzman_edn42"\n                                                                                                  name="_weitzman_ednref42"\n                                                                                                  title=""><sup>[42]</sup></a>\n    This general perception was in flux, as some maps were reformulated to reflect newly discovered landmasses, while\n    goods\u2014even people\u2014arrived in Florence through Medici connections and gift exchange.<a href="#_weitzman_edn43"\n                                                                                          name="_weitzman_ednref43"\n                                                                                          title=""><sup>[43]</sup></a>\n    In painting the armory ceiling to supplement the weapons on display, Ludovico Buti was responding to the New World\n    context as framed by Medici court culture. </p>\n<p>As Eviatar Zerubavel argues, Vespucci was one of few pundits who set the precedent for the intellectual shift of\n    imagining and depicting the New World as a separate landmass from Asia.<a href="#_weitzman_edn44"\n                                                                              name="_weitzman_ednref44"\n                                                                              title=""><sup>[44]</sup></a> Why, then,\n    did the Medici continue to reference imagery that continued to conflate the two continents, in turn depicting an\n    ambiguous amalgam of cultures on the armory ceiling? Due to the ubiquitous nature of these widely known prints\n    disseminated within the court, narrative and ethnographic pictorial representations were slower to follow suit. The\n    Medici embraced these anachronistic tendencies by using them as references in their imagery. Even maps such as those\n    contained in Ortelius\u2019s atlas that separated the continents weren\u2019t entirely confident that America wasn\u2019t part of\n    Asia. Further, the Medici family\u2019s liberal practice of categorizing objects, coupled with the fluid definition of\n    the word \u201cIndian,\u201d helped build an environment in which projection of the New World mirrored the Old, lightly\n    grasping at Ptolemaic tradition. Thus, the idea of a continent of America untouched by Asia was slow to formulate\n    even in Medici Florence where Vespucci carried a legacy. The armory was a commission by a powerful Ducal family in\n    the midst of establishing its identity not only among dignitaries from Spain and Portugal who had a hand in New\n    World exploration, but also within a shifting worldview that required revisions of its classical\n    antecedent.<a href="#_weitzman_edn45"\n                  name="_weitzman_ednref45"\n                  title=""><sup>[45]</sup></a> The result is a representation of a New World that is not completely\n    divorced from Asia, situated in a court culture that was simultaneously well aware of Vespucci\u2019s innovative\n    observations of a separate New World. Thus the fresco is an example of a hyper-local, as well as larger, continental\n    identity in flux\u2014a process of reconciliation of the anachronistic Ptolemaic ancient practice and development of an\n    understanding of a brand-new, largely unknown society across the Atlantic. The Medici were working through what\n    Zerubavel calls \u201cdenial\u201d\u2013 \u201ca way of resisting the unfamiliar by forcing it into familiar mental niches, thereby\n    practically denying its novelty or unusualness.\u201d<sup> </sup><a\n            href="#_weitzman_edn46"\n            name="_weitzman_ednref46"\n            title=""><sup>[46]</sup></a> A dichotomy existed between Francesco\u2019s desire to have agency in the discovery\n    of the New World and its profound implications on the early modern world. In step with the loose categorization of\n    Medici objects, appropriation of multifarious New World prints and texts circulating throughout Europe, and the\n    atlases that situated the American landmass in the East, Ferdinando projected an image of Amerasia on the armory\n    ceiling that the Medici court would have expected to see.\xa0 </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Bibliography</h3>\n<p>Boone, Elizabeth Hill.\n    \u201cSeeking Indianness: Christoph Weiditz, the Aztecs, and Feathered Amerindians.\u201d <i>Colonial Latin American Review</i>, vol. 26, no. 1, 2017, pp. 39\u201361.\n</p>\n<p>Davies, Surekha. <i>Renaissance\n    Ethnography and the Invention of the Human: New Worlds, Maps and Monsters</i>.\n    Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2017.</p>\n<p>Feest, Christian. \u201cThe\n    People of Calicut: Objects, Texts, and Images in the Age of Proto-Ethnography.\u201d <i>Boletim Do Museu Paraense Em\xedlio Goeldi.

However, cartographic representations of China still followed the conventions of\n    the genre of the fifteenth century that were inherited from Marco Polo\u2019s accounts of China. Tangut (Northwestern\n    China), Cathay (Northern China), and Mangi (Southern China), the three main destinations on Polo\u2019s itinerary in\n    China, were upheld as the three main toponyms used to represent China in sixteenth century world maps, while\n    \u201cCanton\u201d, the most important port city for Portuguese travelers in the sixteenth century, had not yet been shown in\n    those maps.<a href="#_edn1"\n                  name="_ednref1"\n                  title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> At first glance it seems the cartographic representation of China remained\n    intact, but if we look closer at the toponyms in its surroundings we begin to see that the representation of its\n    geographical relationship with the New World did change.</p>\n<p>By pointing out how several toponyms moved around the Old-World reference points --Cathay, Tangut, and Mangi --in a\n    series of maps, I aim to show how Europeans reconfigured their conceptions of the world\u2019s expansiveness and the\n    distinctive ways that they imagined Amerasia. The main body of the essay is divided into three sections\n    corresponding to the categorization of ten selected maps. While two body sections contain different manifestations\n    of Amerasia, the Amerasian phenomenon is absent in the remaining one. Next, this essay will examine how <i>The\n        Travels of Marco Polo </i>contributed to two types of Amerasian maps.</p>\n<p><b>The Amerasian phenomenon near The Tropic of Cancer</b></p>\n<p>The first type of sixteenth-century world map, which has the greatest number of surviving copies, represents Asia and\n    what we now call North America as one single landmass and portrays South America as an extension of Asia.

Since Marco Polo had\n    expanded the eastern end of the island of the Earth by exploring the immense Chinese provinces of Cathay and Mangi,\n    along with an adjacent archipelago and the great island of Cipangu, Columbus gained the impression that the\n    intervening ocean between the western shores of Europe and the eastern shores of Asia were not very great, leading\n    him to convince the Spanish court to allow him to sail west to India. As soon as he sighted land sometime between\n    the eleventh and twelfth of October, 1492, he was sure he had arrived in Asia.<a href="#_edn3"\n                                                                                     name="_ednref3"\n                                                                                     title=""><sup>[3]</sup></a>\n    Whatever he saw during the rest of his exploration he interpreted as empirical evidence of this fixed belief. Here\n    we have to bear in mind that <i>The Travels of Marco Polo</i> did not serve as textual evidence for Columbus to\n    prove that land was Asia; rather, it served as a formulation in Columbus\u2019s mind which was so deep-rooted that it\n    made him consistently align his exploration along the coast of the New Land with Marco Polo\u2019s return trip from\n    Zaiton to Europe.<a href="#_edn4"\n                        name="_ednref4"\n                        title=""><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>\n<p>In the Gilt Globe (1528), while \u201cTangut\u201d is placed on the Northwest side of \u201cCathay\u201d and \u201cMangi\u201d on the south,\n    \u201cHispania Nova\u201d indicates the territory of New Spain at the center of the triangle formed by \u201cTangut\u201d, \u2018Cathay\u201c and\n    \u201cMangi\u201d. \u201cTemixtitan\u201d is depicted right above \u201cMangi\u201d.

The development of world maps in the sixteenth century could not be seen as a teleological process where a\n    much clearer picture of the modern worldview came into being over time. Instead, it was a period when plural\n    worldviews driven by different ideologies co-existed and reshaped each other during the sixteenth century. While\n    Amerasia was a dominant worldview in the sixteenth century, it did adjust and rearrange itself, responding to the\n    challenges posed by its opposite side --the maps showing the hypothesis that Asia and the New World were separated\n    from one another. Meanwhile, even maps or mapmakers that experimented with a two-continent vision were subject to\n    changing their minds, as Waldseem\xfcller reverted to an Amerasian vision of the world in his 1516 Carta Marina.\n    Furthermore, sometimes even when maps separated the continents, they still embraced an Amerasian view.</p>\n<p><b>The Amerasian phenomenon in the North</b></p>\n<p>After Waldseem\xfcller, many began to accept that South America was a New World, but the North American connection to\n    Asia persisted. In the middle of the sixteenth century there emerged a third type of world map which separated the\n    east coast of Asia from the lower part of today\u2019s North America with a vast ocean. </p>\n<p>In response to this trend of separating Asia from today\u2019s North America in the area around the Tropic of Cancer, the\n    Amerasian phenomenon persisted by spreading northward. The displacement of several Asian toponyms around Cathay,\n    such as Ania and Toloman, plays an essential role in displaying Amerasia\u2019s new form at the stage when China was no\n    longer intermingled with Mexico.<a href="#_edn5"\n                                       name="_ednref5"\n                                       title=""><sup>[5]</sup></a> According to Marco Polo, Toloman was an Asian kingdom\n    in southwestern China abundant in gold.

The\n    placement of toponyms mentioned in <i>The Travel of Marco Polo, </i>such as Tolman in the New World, emphasized the\n    New World\u2019s connection to the Venetian historical figure, which reflected how Venetians positioned themselves in the\n    exploration of the New World even if they didn\u2019t physically participate in the age of discoveries.</p>\n<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>\n<p>Marco Polo\u2019s exploration of the Land of the East unfolded around Cathay, and his itinerary provided the basic\n    geographical knowledge of East Asia, serving as an established textual source for European cartographers to depict\n    China on world maps from the late fourteenth century.<a href="#_edn9"\n                                                            name="_ednref9"\n                                                            title=""><sup>[9]</sup></a> In the sixteenth century, as the\n    European Age of Encounters unfolded concurrently with the print revolution, accounts of Columbian voyages were\n    disseminated around Europe with his point of view of seeing the New World and Asia as one.<a href="#_edn10"\n                                                                                                 name="_ednref10"\n                                                                                                 title=""><sup>[10]</sup></a>\n</p>\n<p>Marco Polo\u2019s effect on Columbus\u2019 cosmographical concepts contributed to the pervasiveness of a series of Amerasian\n    maps that depict today\u2019s Mexico Gulf and China Sea as one and place Mexico within the land of Asia throughout the\n    sixteenth century. But in the second half of the sixteenth century, there was a tendency for more maps separating\n    these two regions at a great distance. </p>\n<p>However, this perceived separation did not mean that the Amerasian phenomenon no longer existed in this group of\n    maps. The publication of a new edition of <i>The Travels of Marco Polo </i>published by Ramusio in the 1550s pushed\n    the Amerasian phenomenon into a new form in the north, responding to the maps that separate Asia and the New World\n    in the area near the Tropic of Cancer. When European cartographers expressed the idea of Amerasia they could either\n    squeeze some toponyms of the New World into Asia, as they did in the region near the Tropic of Cancer, or they could\n    extend some Asian toponymies, like Toloman, towards the other side of world, as they did in the North.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<div id=edn1>\n    <p><a href="#_ednref1"\n          name="_edn1"\n          title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a>Serge Gruzinski mentions that although the Portuguese had reached the Chinese coast\n        by 1513, sailing form Malacca.

It is a point toward which we look for something better, more ideal.\n    Conversely, on Earth, our mortal existence is full of sacrifice and duress, compromise and corruption. From a\n    biblical perspective, Paradise represents both human sin and salvation, bookending the human experience between\n    man\u2019s creation and fall and the final judgment and redemption.<a href="#_chang_edn1"\n                                                                     name="_chang_ednref1"\n                                                                     title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> This perspective of\n    Paradise sets it apart from the human experience, and until the 5th century, it was not necessarily understood as a\n    physical or achievable space. The argument of the Terrestrial Paradise<a\n            href="#_chang_edn2"\n            name="_chang_ednref2"\n            title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a> complicates the relationship between humans and Paradise by creating the\n    possibility of access to a space that was once understood to be unachievable. The Terrestrial Paradise becomes at\n    once a space that is simultaneously real and imaginary, existing somewhere among man\u2019s original sin, mortal\n    suffering, and salvation. This paradox persists in maps and narrative accounts of the Middle Ages, and continues to\n    vex and enchant exegetes and explorers into the 15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> centuries. The voyages of\n    Christopher Columbus complicate our relationship with Paradise when, on his Third Voyage, Columbus claims to have\n    found it. However, the link to the rhetoric of Paradise begins with his First Voyage and the discovery of lands to\n    the West.</p>\n<p>On Caspar Vopel\u2019s 1545 map the Terrestrial Paradise does not make an appearance. It no longer figures into the\n    cartography of the time. As 16<sup>th</sup> century explorers expand the understandings of the physical world, the\n    possibility of a Terrestrial Paradise begins to fade. Vopel binds East and West in his heart-shaped Earth, and in\n    doing so, sets the Americas adjacent to Europe, but attached to China. This configuration leaves no room for a\n    Paradise that was once thought to be on the obverse of the world. However, the idea of Paradise still persists in\n    the imaginary. There are still traces of the medieval marvels that inspired Columbus and his fellow explorers to\n    seek the New World. Perhaps the evidence of Paradise lies in the presence of \u201ccannibals, amazons, and\n    anthropophagi<i>,\u201d </i>as suggested by the likes of Mandeville and d\u2019Ailly and scattered throughout the lands of\n    Asia and America on Vopel\u2019s map. </p>\n<p>The discovery of Terrestrial Paradise by Christopher Columbus on his third voyage complicates understandings of the\n    known world in the certitude with which he declares his discovery and his conviction in the evidence\n    given.<a href="#_chang_edn3"\n             name="_chang_ednref3"\n             title=""><sup>[3]</sup></a> This can be a jarring revelation unless we first explore the history of man\u2019s\n    relationship with the idea of Paradise, and the accounts of Columbus\u2019 first voyage. According to the histories\n    provided by Las Casas,<a href="#_chang_edn4"\n                             name="_chang_ednref4"\n                             title=""><sup>[4]</sup></a> it is understood that, upon arrival on the eastern most point\n    of Cuba, Columbus gives it the name: \u201cAlpha et Omega.\u201d<a href="#_chang_edn5"\n                                                             name="_chang_ednref5"\n                                                             title=""><sup>[5]</sup></a> While this particular\n    appellation does not specifically refer to Paradise, the idea of the binary of beginning and end existing in one\n    space hearkens back to medieval models of Paradise.</p>\n<p>Along with other maps of the twelfth century, the Hereford Map conceived of a world that encompasses both physical\n    and spiritual realms. While Columbus would not necessarily have used mappae mundi such as this to navigate, the\n    prevalence of these pieces provided a framework with which to think about the understandings of the world through\n    the thirteenth century and their influence on fifteenth century thinkers. Characteristic of mappae mundi, the\n    Hereford Map is oriented to the East as opposed to the North,<a href="#_chang_edn6"\n                                                                    name="_chang_ednref6"\n                                                                    title=""><sup>[6]</sup></a> establishing a hierarchy\n    of distance ranging from the lands of the European continent to the vast reaches of the East as represented by Asia.<a\n            href="#_chang_edn7"\n            name="_chang_ednref7"\n            title=""><sup>[7]</sup></a> In such maps, the Terrestrial Paradise is represented at the very apex.</p>\n<p>The effects of such a representation are manifold. A noteworthy effect this creates is that the Middle East or, for\n    medieval audiences, the Holy Land, takes its place at the center of the map. In the Hereford Map, Jerusalem is\n    clearly represented as an almost gear-like fortress. This emphasizes the center of the medieval world as the holy\n    lands of Christianity and the combination of spiritual and physical worlds.</p>\n<p>Following in a line eastward to the top of the Hereford map, we find the island Paradise, a representation of the\n    Terrestrial Paradise as an island at the farthest reaches of the map. Clearly labeled, the island Paradise bears\n    common imagery across most representations. Here, the Terrestrial Paradise is also marked with the four rivers of\n    Paradise.<a href="#_chang_edn8"\n                name="_chang_ednref8"\n                title=""><sup>[8]</sup></a> The placement of Paradise at the easternmost extreme of the map reinforces\n    its place, not at the periphery of the world, but at its beginning. In addition, the scene above the Hereford Map\n    also places Paradise in proximity to the Last Judgment and the end of days. These representations make Paradise\n    accessible by placing it on the map, and yet spiritual in its relation to the beginning and end of humanity.\n    Columbus\u2019 idea of \u201cAlpha et Omega\u201d seems here to have found a cartographic antecedent, but again, Columbus did not\n    believe he had found Paradise on that first voyage. The significance here is that Paradise occupies space at the\n    beginning and the end of the known world. </p>\n<p>As Columbus does nine centuries later, Augustine of Hippo began a process of epistemology that would confuse the\n    known and unkown. While Augustine\u2019s arguments for a Terrestrial Paradise are rooted in exegesis and interpretations\n    of Genesis,<a href="#_chang_edn9"\n                  name="_chang_ednref9"\n                  title=""><sup>[9]</sup></a> they establish a context through which the negotiation of the visible and\n    invisible can begin. \u201cHistory was not the result of some cosmic fall, but a process set in motion by God himself.\n    The visible world was no mere reflection of a higher and eternal reality, but the work of an omnipotent creator and\n    the stage on which God\u2019s plan for the salvation of mankind was to be enacted.\u201d<a href="#_chang_edn10"\n                                                                                     name="_chang_ednref10"\n                                                                                     title=""><sup>[10]</sup></a> Here,\n    Scafi engages the relationship between the visible and the invisible world as a stage on which salvation is\n    situated. The relationship between man and the Terrestrial Paradise is thus that of a play or a performance.

Couched in the context of religion, the\n    early mappae mundi represented the spiritual and physical understandings established by Augustine of Hippo. In fact,\n    they were an acknowledgement of the existence of a physical world with known boundaries around which a greater\n    spiritual landscape existed. The imago mundi, or image of the world created by such maps, incorporated the\n    Terrestrial Paradise as a key component. The island nature of early representations reinforce contemporary accounts\n    of the inaccessibility of Paradise. The wall and ring of fire surrounding the Island Paradise in the Hereford Map\n    not only references Genesis,<a href="#_chang_edn13"\n                                   name="_chang_ednref13"\n                                   title=""><sup>[13]</sup></a> but also reinforces contemporary accounts and encounters\n    with the Terrestrial Paradise.</p>\n<p>It is through these accounts that Columbus builds points of reference for his Third Voyage.<a\n        href="#_chang_edn14"\n        name="_chang_ednref14"\n        title=""><sup>[14]</sup></a> In addition to the work of Marco Polo, Columbus was known to have kept notes on\n    medieval travel narratives. While Marco Polo\u2019s account did not reference Paradise, other medieval accounts offered\n    more insight into the subject of the Terrestrial Paradise. Many such narratives, like John Mandeville\u2019s \u201cBook of\n    Marvels and Travels\u201d<a href="#_chang_edn15"\n                           name="_chang_ednref15"\n                           title=""><sup>[15]</sup></a> were widely circulated beginning in the fourteenth century. Such\n    narratives exposed their audiences to a diverse and marvelous world at the reaches of the known world. Despite his\n    vast explorations, Mandeville also famously avoids engaging specifically with Paradise: \u201cI can\u2019t really describe\n    Paradise properly because I haven\u2019t been there, and that grieves me. However, I\u2019ll describe what I\u2019ve heard from\n    wise men.\u201d<a href="#_chang_edn16"\n                 name="_chang_ednref16"\n                 title=""><sup>[16]</sup></a> Mandeville goes on to note details in line with contemporary\n    understanding, such as Paradise\u2019s proximity to the lands of Prester John\u2019s kingdom,<a\n            href="#_chang_edn17"\n            name="_chang_ednref17"\n            title=""><sup>[17]</sup></a> as well as it being situated at a great elevation.<a href="#_chang_edn18"\n                                                                                              name="_chang_ednref18"\n                                                                                              title=""><sup>[18]</sup></a>\n    Here the medieval audience learns of the names of the four rivers as well as the origins of their contemporary\n    appellations,<a href="#_chang_edn19"\n                    name="_chang_ednref19"\n                    title=""><sup>[19]</sup></a> but again, the account is brief. Mandeville\u2019s account reinforces the\n    dynamic between what is known and what is unknown about Paradise. Honest though it may be, the inability to describe\n    Paradise properly grieves Mandeville. The location of his discussion of Paradise is as notable as the brevity of the\n    discussion, as it takes place only as a one-page aside from his description of Prester John near the very end of the\n    text. Knowledge, or more accurately the lack of first-hand knowledge, manifests itself here in Mandeville\u2019s account.\n</p>\n<p>The conception of Paradise is characterized by the struggle to express the inexpressible, but in his Third Voyage,\n    Columbus no longer struggles. Bolstered by medieval accounts such as those of Mandeville and the Voyages of St.\n    Brendan, Columbus takes a decidedly southern route through the Canaries, past Cabo Verde<a href="#_chang_edn20"\n                                                                                               name="_chang_ednref20"\n                                                                                               title=""><sup>[20]</sup></a>\n    to points nearer to the tropics. In doing so Columbus sets off a chain of events established by earlier\n    models.<a href="#_chang_edn21"\n              name="_chang_ednref21"\n              title=""><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>\n\n<p>By the third voyage Columbus had already encountered islands inhabited by women, and cannibals, all of which were\n    consistent with medieval accounts of the lands nearest to Paradise.<a\n            href="#_chang_edn22"\n            name="_chang_ednref22"\n            title=""><sup>[22]</sup></a> Beginning with the tropics themselves, Columbus\u2019 aggressive approach has been\n    interpreted in various ways, but under the assumption that if Columbus sailed with the intention of finding Paradise\n    the first barrier would be to confront the flaming sword that stood guard at the gates after the Expulsion. As\n    detailed by the zonal maps in Pierre d\u2019Ailly\u2019s Imago Mundi, the tropics were the edge of the \u201ctorrid\n    zone.\u201d<a href="#_chang_edn23"\n             name="_chang_ednref23"\n             title=""><sup>[23]</sup></a> Like \u201cAlpha et Omega\u201d, Columbus was aware of his approaching the edge of the\n    known world. Through medieval exegesis and maps like the Hereford Map we see a pattern of evidence that points to\n    the understanding of the tropics as the precipice upon which the known world is perched.</p>\n<p>As Columbus notes 100 leagues off the coast of Cabo Verde, he experiences resistance due to the fact that he may be\n    traveling upward, which is where he reinforces his idea of the pear-shaped earth<a href="#_chang_edn24"\n                                                                                       name="_chang_ednref24"\n                                                                                       title=""><sup>[24]</sup></a>.\n    While seemingly outlandish, this convention comes from sources like Mandeville who, in his short section on\n    Paradise, expresses that it is perhaps the highest point on Earth, so high it touches the moon.<a href="#_chang_edn25"\n                                                                                                      name="_chang_ednref25"\n                                                                                                      title=""><sup>[25]</sup></a>\n    However false the idea may be, it is reinforced by writers like d\u2019Ailly, whose zonal maps<a href="#_chang_edn26"\n                                                                                                name="_chang_ednref26"\n                                                                                                title=""><sup>[26]</sup></a>\n    followed the Geography of Ptolemy and also included contemporary planar maps showing the various forces affecting\n    the Earth. Columbus\u2019 pear-shaped Earth is but an adaptation of that idea. As he moves ever towards Paradise,\n    Columbus does the work of Augustine of Hippo. Columbus combines both sacred and secular accounts into the quest for\n    Paradise.</p>\n<p>Upon again reaching the islands west of the known world, Columbus begins to name and identify land masses based on\n    medieval conventions, such as those of the Voyages of Saint Brendan.<a\n            href="#_chang_edn27"\n            name="_chang_ednref27"\n            title=""><sup>[27]</sup></a> The various islands, waterways and land masses encountered on the third voyage\n    bring the lands of Saint Brendan from fiction to reality. While not the first to materialize St Brendan\u2019s voyages.<a\n            href="#_chang_edn28"\n            name="_chang_ednref28"\n            title=""><sup>[28]</sup></a> Columbus\u2019 active naming on this journey is consistent with the generative\n    agency of Adam as he names all of the creatures and objects of the Earth. For Columbus, it marks the end of the\n    Saint Brendan narrative and the beginning of the Columbus narrative. Once again, the quest for Paradise has\n    traversed an end and a beginning. But it is rare for an explorer like Columbus to be so dedicated to the\n    appropriation of one narrative. In the earlier voyages, the lands discovered were named for his patrons in the royal\n    court of Spain in very appropriate acts of tribute.</p>\n\n<p>In thinking about why Columbus would have adhered so closely to the particular narrative of Saint Brendan, we may\n    consider the circumstances by which Columbus arrives and returns from this particular voyage. Valerie Flint examines\n    in great detail the medieval sources for Columbus\u2019 third voyage, as well as the inauspicious circumstances in which\n    he returned to Spain,<a href="#_chang_edn29"\n                            name="_chang_ednref29"\n                            title=""><sup>[29]</sup></a> but what Flint does not necessarily examine is the shift in\n    language between Columbus\u2019 letters from the first and second voyages and his letter from the third voyage. It is the\n    language here that relates back to the quest for Paradise. The letters of the first two voyages begin formally, with\n    the first being addressed to \u201cSir\u201d<a href="#_chang_edn30"\n                                         name="_chang_ednref30"\n                                         title=""><sup>[30]</sup></a> and the second beginning with, \u201cMost noble\n    sir.\u201d<a href="#_chang_edn31"\n            name="_chang_ednref31"\n            title=""><sup>[31]</sup></a> The language here may be attributed to their being addressed to court officials\n    or the writers being members of the crew, the matter of formality being particular to subjects of the royal\n    highness. These first two letters are matter-of-fact reports of findings and interactions. That being said, the\n    letter of the third voyage is penned by Columbus himself, and is not nearly as formal or reserved. It begins, not as\n    a report, but more as a plea: \u201cMost serene and most exalted and powerful Princes, the King and Queen, our\n    Sovereigns: The Blessed Trinity of His Infinite goodness has chosen me to proclaim it to you; wherefore as His\n    ambassador I approached your royal presence, moved by the consideration that I was appealing to the most exalted\n    monarchs in Christendom, who exercised so great an influence over the Christian faith, and its advancement in the\n    world.\u201d<a\n            href="#_chang_edn32"\n            name="_chang_ednref32"\n            title=""><sup>[32]</sup></a> It is in these contrasts that we find the essence of Paradise as a space that\n    can not be realized, and yet still exists. The latter account calls not only on the royalty of the audience, but on\n    their faith. It invokes the Blessed Trinity and proclaims Columbus as not just an Admiral, but an ambassador of God.\n    Columbus truly believed that he had seen the Terrestrial Paradise.</p>\n\n<p>Madness is often attributed to Columbus on this particular voyage, but it was faith that drove Columbus, not madness.<a href="#_chang_edn33"\n                                                                                                                           name="_chang_ednref33"\n                                                                                                                           title=""><sup>[33]</sup></a>\n    At every turn in the Third Voyage Columbus took risks and was delivered from danger. As he skirted the coast of the\n    Peninsula Paria and experienced the incomprehensible mixing of sweet water into the bay in inconceivable amounts,\n    Columbus begins to piece together the idea of Paradise. His amazement, coupled with medieval antecedents, allows for\n    Columbus to proclaim his discovery of the Terrestrial Paradise with confidence.<a href="#_chang_edn34"\n                                                                                      name="_chang_ednref34"\n                                                                                      title=""><sup>[34]</sup></a> Even\n    when it is clear the Paradise he has discovered is not an island but a peninsula, Columbus\u2019 faith is not shaken. His\n    change of perspective is not without its medieval precedents,<a href="#_chang_edn35"\n                                                                    name="_chang_ednref35"\n                                                                    title=""><sup>[35]</sup></a> but the ease with which\n    the perspective shifts is at the heart of man\u2019s relationship to Paradise.</p>\n\n<p>The key here is the mutability of Paradise. Existing both in the beginning and at the end and extending to the\n    extreme edges of the known world, Paradise and the Terrestrial Paradise continue to be elusive. While this paradox\n    seems to have been solved by Columbus in his third voyage, the medieval antecedents of Paradise show how fractured\n    an understanding so illusory a space provides. In the case of Columbus\u2019 voyages, he does seem to disrupt this\n    fracture by collapsing medieval models. By the time Magellan circumnavigates the globe, there is no longer room for\n    Paradise on the sphere of the Earth. The only spaces left for the concept of Paradise to inhabit were in the hearts\n    and minds of the faithful.</p>\n\n<p>With the exception of the Columbus Map, representations of Paradise become less frequent in the sixteenth and\n    seventeenth centuries. No longer included in imago mundi, Paradise returns to a conceptual space. The argument of\n    the Terrestrial Paradise does not end with Columbus however. Christianity needed Paradise to exist in a\n    post-Columbian world.<a href="#_chang_edn36"\n                            name="_chang_ednref36"\n                            title=""><sup>[36]</sup></a> While Columbus proclaimed proudly that he had found Paradise,\n    the subsequent expeditions to map and understand the New World landscape found no examples of the fabled land of\n    Adam and Eve. John Milton, and exegetes of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries began to shift the paradigm of\n    Paradise to speak of it as an extant, but lost space. While still a place to be found, theories of Paradise shifted\n    from an existing space to a space relegated to the bottom of the sea by the Great Flood. Here we leave the Paradise\n    conversation at the bottom of the sea.</p>\n\n<p>Whether at the bottom of the sea or the top of a mountain, the idea of Paradise still exists in its purest form, and\n    is able to survive multiple interpretations and conceptions. It is able to inspire action and faith. The argument\n    for a terrestrial Paradise is one that spans nearly a millennium and is able to produce artifacts like the Hereford\n    map and subsequently impact the way man conceives of the physical world. The medieval narratives of John Mandeville\n    and Pierre D\u2019Ailly that involve Paradise form the way medieval man conceived of his world and relations with those\n    in the world. Paradise occupies both figurative and literal, physical and the spiritual space. Elements of Paradise\n    remain in the form of the Behaim Globe of 1492, which does not incorporate Paradise, but following medieval models\n    like the Island of St Brendan. Seeking to combine both spiritual and physical worlds, Columbus was only successful\n    in condensing the material representations. His third voyage does not necessarily disrupt, the paradox of Paradise;\n    in fact, it reinforces its elusiveness by eliminating a possible location for the Terrestrial Paradise.</p>\n\n<p>Having closed the door on the medieval conversation about Terrestrial Paradise, Columbus opened the door to new and\n    varied interpretations. His own celebration of the discovery questioned the relationship between faith and nation.\n    Columbus\u2019 overture to the royal court of Spain appealed to their faith, but ultimately appealed for their support of\n    his expeditions. In this moment, Paradise becomes a political tool. In invoking Paradise, Columbus simultaneously\n    established the lands to the west as old and new spaces. The Columbus World Map<a href="#_chang_edn37"\n                                                                                      name="_chang_ednref37"\n                                                                                      title=""><sup>[37]</sup></a> shows\n    just such a relationship. The map is curiously Eurocentric, as the main map does not even show the extent of Asia,\n    let alone Columbus\u2019 discoveries. It is the smaller, planar map that shows the most detail. Fashioned after Ptolemy\u2019s\n    nine spheres, the planar map includes the lands of the East and, most conspicuously, Paradise at the far East. Still\n    there are no representations of the Columbus\u2019 discoveries in the New World, but what the Columbus world map does is\n    keep the idea of Paradise alongside the theories of Ptolemy. The sacred and the secular function together here in\n    similar ways. By combining the geographical theories of Ptolemy and the medieval interpretations of Paradise,\n    Columbus was able to achieve his greatest discoveries.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<div id=edn1>\n\n    <p><a href="#_chang_ednref1"\n          name="_chang_edn1"\n          title=""> <sup>[1]</sup></a> <i>The Holy Bible: King James Version</i>.

Depictions of Prester John and his realm are ubiquitous early\n        on, most notably in maps, as European cartographers\u2019 dependence on maps was a crucial element in pinpointing the\n        location of Prester John.

Maps from the Middle Ages had depicted Ethiopia and India as bordering land massed, with the\n        Indian Ocean severely reduced. In the Age of Exploration European cosmographers divided India in two parts,\n        Indus and the Ganges and Beyond the Ganges, with Africa depicted separately.</p>\n    <p>In a 1450-60 <i>Catalan World Map</i>, by an anonymous Spanish artist (Figs. 2a, 2b),<a href="#pivar_edn11"\n                                                                                               name="pivar_ednref11"\n                                                                                               title=""><sup>[11]</sup></a>\n        Prester John is located in Africa and is depicted as a dark-skinned ruler sitting on a throne in a tent,\n        surrounded by other rulers of the continent.

The figures crowd in the foreground: the Madonna sits with the Christ Child on her lap\n    behind a low parapet, and the three Magi approach her from the left. The eldest king kneels with his hat off and his\n    hands clasped in prayer; he has already given his gift, which the Virgin now passes to Joseph. Behind him stand the\n    other two Magi, one removing his hat in reverence, the other striding forward and holding out his gift. It is this\n    third Magus who has captured scholarly attention. His feather headdress and the arrow he holds have been\n    convincingly identified with the Tupinamba people of Brazil, first encountered by the Portuguese explorer Pedro\n    Alvares Cabral in 1500, shortly before the date of Fernandes\u2019 painting.<a href="#strauss_edn7"\n                                                                              name="strauss_ednref7"\n                                                                              title=""><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>\n\n<p>As Joseph Koerner and others have noted, this connection to Portuguese exploration is crucial for understanding the\n    painting and its inclusion of an American Magus.

Though the Horn\n    of Africa extends further east than the Holy Land, traveling from East Africa to Bethlehem would still predominantly\n    be a northward journey.

The Cantino Planisphere (<a\n            href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Cantino_planisphere_%281502%29.jpg"\n            target="_blank">here</a>), created just after Cabral\u2019s voyage and reflecting his new discoveries, also\n    situates Brazil to the west. In this representation, the western end of Brazil is left undetermined, and it is\n    uncertain whether a land route traveling westward would even be possible. </p>\n\n<p>An anonymous Bolognese painting of the <i>Adoration of the Magi</i> (<a\n        href="http://catalogo.fondazionezeri.unibo.it/scheda.v2.jsp?locale=en&amp;decorator=layout_resp&amp;apply=true&amp;tipo_scheda=F&amp;id=83108&amp;titolo=Anonimo+-+Anonimo+bolognese+-+sec.+XVI+-+Adorazione+dei+Re+Magi+-+insieme">here</a>),\n    dating to the mid to late 16<sup>th</sup> century, again raises the question of how someone from the New World could\n    have traveled to see the infant Christ. Here, however, the figure in question is not one of the three kings\n    presenting their gifts before the Madonna and Child in the center foreground (<a\n            href="http://catalogo.fondazionezeri.unibo.it/scheda.v2.jsp?locale=en&amp;decorator=layout_resp&amp;apply=true&amp;tipo_scheda=F&amp;id=83111&amp;titolo=Anonimo+-+Anonimo+bolognese+-+sec.+XVI+-+Adorazione+dei+Re+Magi+-+particolare">here</a>).\n    These kings reveal a range of skin tones and geographical markers, and can plausibly be identified as a kneeling\n    East Asian king who gazes up at the Christ Child who blesses him, a dark-skinned African king with a turban, and\n    another turbaned king with a beard who is likely Near Eastern.<a href="#strauss_edn19"\n                                                                     name="strauss_ednref19"\n                                                                     title=""><sup>[19]</sup></a>\n</p>\n\n<p>One of the figures in the midground at the left of the panel (<a\n        href="http://catalogo.fondazionezeri.unibo.it/scheda.v2.jsp?locale=en&amp;decorator=layout_resp&amp;apply=true&amp;tipo_scheda=F&amp;id=83110&amp;titolo=Anonimo+-+Anonimo+bolognese+-+sec.+XVI+-+Corteo+dei+Re+Magi+-+particolare">here</a>),\n    however, appears to be wearing a feathered headdress and other feathered decoration around his neck, attire which\n    strikingly resembles the woodcut images of cannibals made to illustrate an account of the discoveries of Amerigo\n    Vespucci (Figure 2). Though it is currently impossible to identify the animal he is riding, the figure holds a\n    heraldic trumpet, suggesting that he is a part of the entourage of one of the three kings. This seems to support the\n    belief that the people of the New World were, in fact, inhabitants of Asia. The feathered figure here, then, must be\n    understood as both a figure from the New World and the subject of an East Asian monarch. While to modern eyes, this\n    appears to be an erroneous conflation of America and Asia, understanding the painting on its own historical terms\n    allows both of these identities to coexist within the same figure. As the Vopel Map attests, portions of East Asia\n    known to Marco Polo and the newly discovered New World were sufficiently proximate geographically to justify the\n    presence of a New World figure in the retinue of a far eastern king.</p>\n\n<p>The other set of Magian images that clearly include figures from the New World are paintings created in the Americas.\n    Trexler notes that particularly in the Andean region around modern Peru, European colonizers of the early\n    16<sup>th</sup> century sought for evidence that Christianity had already reached the New World in antiquity,\n    including by suggesting the possibility of a Native American Magus.<a\n            href="#strauss_edn20"\n            name="strauss_ednref20"\n            title=""><sup>[20]</sup></a> A 17<sup>th</sup> century painting by Diego de la Puente visualizes this\n    possibility, showing one of the Magi in the robes and headdress of an Incan king (<a\n            href="https://preview.redd.it/kvlncjnjql101.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04faf8eac1df70c5d6b0646654e5925f34353f65"\n            target="_blank">here</a>).<a\n            href="#strauss_edn21"\n            name="strauss_ednref21"\n            title=""><sup>[21]</sup></a> Unlike European images with New World figures, the inclusion of an Incan Magus\n    here is most likely motivated by practical and propagandistic reasons. In the Andes, depicting three Magi from the\n    Old World (for instance, an African figure, an Ottoman figure, and a Chinese figure) would have been all but\n    unintelligible to most non-Europeans. The inclusion of an Incan Magus\u2014particularly in conjunction with an African\n    Magus, who would also represent a potentially recognizable physiognomic type, given the rise of trans-Atlantic\n    slavery\u2014makes the painting more accessible and comprehensible to its immediate audience. The Incan Magus could also\n    serve as a model for native peoples, who could be directed to emulate this painted figure in their own devotion to\n    Christ. </p>\n\n<p>The paintings discussed above are not only valuable as a means of understanding how Europeans reconfigured their\n    conception of the Magi during the Age of Exploration, but they are also pivotal because they are nearly unique\n    examples of New World figures depicted in Magian images.<a href="#strauss_edn22"\n                                                               name="strauss_ednref22"\n                                                               title=""><sup>[22]</sup></a> Given the scarcity of\n    figures shown with distinctive New World iconography in 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> century images of the\n    Magi, it is important to consider other modes of visualizing these geographic discoveries. The following pages\n    consider figures whose foreignness may include or refer to the New World, but in conjunction with areas that we now\n    see as different geographic regions such as India and Africa. These images are particularly intriguing because of\n    the flexibility of the term \u201cIndia\u201d during the Age of Exploration, variously encompassing East Africa, areas of\n    South and East Asia, and the West Indies. (See the essay <a href="#riccio-india">on India and Indians by Vittoria\n        Riccio</a>) Figures that appear to modern scholars to contain mixed iconography might have been originally\n    intended to represent inhabitants of a greater India. It is important to note, however, that the connections between\n    the subsequent images and the New World are also more tenuous\u2014the iconographic elements discussed could equally have\n    Asian or African sources, but are included here because of their potential resonances with imagery from both the Old\n    World and the New. </p>\n\n<p>A particularly rich image for this avenue of investigation is Francisco de Holanda\u2019s <i>Adoration of the Magi</i> (<a\n        href="http://bdh-rd.bne.es/viewer.vm?id=0000137315&amp;page=86"\n        target="_blank">here</a>), from his <i>De aetatibus mundi imagines</i>, a collection of cosmological drawings\n    from the Creation to the Apocalypse. The three Magi kneel at the right of the image, each modeling a different form\n    of devotion toward the seated Virgin and the Child she holds. The foremost Magus presses his hands to the ground,\n    his face down; this particular posture of worship, in conjunction with the curved sword at his side, may suggest a\n    Near Eastern figure. The second Magus, who is also elderly and bearded, bows down much like his companion. His\n    hands, however, are clasped in a European gesture of prayer, and his face remains turned toward the Madonna and\n    Christ. If the Magus at the front appears to visualize an Islamic gesture of prayer, the second Magus is more\n    reminiscent of medieval and Byzantine donor portraits, in a pose of <i>proskynesis</i> or veneration.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike the foremost two Magi, whose very similar physiognomies, clothing, and poses offer only a suggestion of their\n    geographic origins, the third Magus provides an entire range of potentially locatable iconography. The features of\n    this Magus and of his followers\u2014one depicted frontally, and another shown in profile, as though providing a full\n    range of views with which to be able to understand these figures\u2014are similar to those of African Magi, as\n    exemplified by a painting by D\xfcrer (<a\n            href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_-_L%27Adoration_des_mages.jpg"\n            target="_blank">here</a>). In addition to their prominent jaws and furrowed brows, these figures are shown\n    beardless with short curly hair, and they each wear earrings\u2014all attributes common to African figures.</p>\n\n<p>The figure\u2019s bangles and headdress, however, point to very different referents. The distinctive two-plume headdress\n    is strikingly similar to one worn by a figure on a Sri Lankan casket (<a\n            href="https://images.tribuneindia.com/cms/gall_content/2018/2/2018_2$largeimg15_Thursday_2018_223007377gallery.jpg"\n            target="_blank">here</a>), who also wears armbands and bracelets. As this casket was a gift from the Sri\n    Lankan ambassador to the Portuguese king, it is possible that Holanda could have seen it and used it as a model,\n    retaining just the headband and the plumes of the Sri Lankan headdress.<a href="#strauss_edn23"\n                                                                              name="strauss_ednref23"\n                                                                              title=""><sup>[23]</sup></a> Figures with\n    similar bangles and headgear are depicted on the Indian subcontinent in the Portuguese Miller Atlas, created in 1519\n    and illustrated by none other than Francisco de Holanda\u2019s father Antonio (<a\n            href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b55002605w/f1.item.zoom"\n            target="_blank">here</a>). Another comparison could be made to representations of the Mesoamerican ruler\n    Moctezuma II (<a\n            href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Houghton_Typ_625.99.800_Istoria_della_conquista_del_Messico_-_Motezuma.jpg"\n            target="_blank">here</a> and <a\n            href="https://www.gettyimages.co.nz/detail/illustration/portrait-of-montezuma-ii-tecnochtitlan-last-king-of-stock-graphic/540779689"\n            target="_blank">here</a>), who also wears gold armbands and a headpiece with a plume to either side. A\n    typological resemblance between Holanda\u2019s Magus and the images of Moctezuma also extends to clothing: both figures\n    are shown seminude, with only a cloak over their shoulders and another garment tied about their waists. </p>\n\n<p>While these references read as fundamentally disparate to modern eyes, a 16<sup>th</sup>-century viewer might have\n    understood them all as falling under the umbrella of the \u201cIndies.\u201d A closer understanding of Holanda\u2019s perception of\n    art on global terms may also help in understanding these references. As Alessandra Russo argues in a current project\n    on Francisco de Holanda and artistic universalism, his commentary in both his <i>Dialogues</i> with Michelangelo and\n    in <i>Da Pintura Antigua</i> reveals that he already attempted to theorize art as a universal trait of humanity.\n    This sort of thinking allowed him to approach Mixtec pottery, for example, and understand it as being comparable to\n    ancient Greek pottery\u2014indeed, to consider the possibility that the New World had contact with Greco-Roman antiquity\n    at some point in the past.<a href="#strauss_edn24"\n                                 name="strauss_ednref24"\n                                 title=""><sup>[24]</sup></a> This particular parallel is especially important for the\n    drawing. Unlike the first two Magi, who are shown in attitudes of prayer, the third Magus is shown in the act of\n    offering his gift: he sets down a vessel before the Virgin and Child, which looks strikingly like an ancient Greek\n    shoulder lekythos (<a\n            href="https://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/tools/pottery/shapes/lekythos.htm"\n            target="_blank">here</a>). His two compatriots, kneeling behind him, also carry their offerings in vessels,\n    though these are more difficult to identify. It is possible that the figure on the left may hold a pyxis, and the\n    simpler vessel to the right may be a krater, but here the parallels to Greek pottery are less distinct.</p>\n\n<p>\xa0These vessels, then, may be a visualization of Holanda\u2019s concept of universal antiquity. While the lekythos seems\n    (at least to modern eyes) clearly identifiable as a Greek vase, the other two slip away from recognizable types.\n    Perhaps the depiction of these vessels, offered by figures who are clearly meant to be foreign\u2014maybe even coming\n    from as far as the New World\u2014was meant to suggest a universal antiquity, visualized through their partial similarity\n    to known Greco-Roman objects. Such an interpretation might imply that Holanda saw these objects as evolutionarily\n    linked: at some point in the past, such as at the time when the Magi went to worship Christ, Greek pottery could\n    have been a universal standard. </p>\n\n<p>In the interest of thoroughness, it is also important to discuss a final category of images: Magi who are depicted\n    using the iconography of African figures, but with the addition of feathered headwear. It is important to note at\n    the outset the methodological framework for examining these images. As Peter Mason aptly observes, feathers appear\n    on both Amerindian and Asian figures. Feathers thus cannot conclusively prove a connection to America; conversely,\n    the absence of feathers cannot preclude such a reference.<a href="#strauss_edn25"\n                                                                name="strauss_ednref25"\n                                                                title=""><sup>[25]</sup></a> One might also add that\n    feathers also appear on the hats of European and African figures. As a result, the examples discussed here are\n    limited to occasions where the feathers seem to be the dominant features of a headdress. </p>\n\n<p>Albrecht D\xfcrer\u2019s 1504 painting of the <i>Adoration of the Magi</i> (<a\n        href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_-_L%27Adoration_des_mages.jpg"\n        target="_blank">here</a>), and his 1511 print of the same subject (<a\n        href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_-_The_Adoration_of_the_Magi_%28NGA_1943.3.3672%29.jpg"\n        target="_blank">here</a>) are particularly helpful for illustrating this slippage.<a href="#strauss_edn26"\n                                                                                             name="strauss_ednref26"\n                                                                                             title=""><sup>[26]</sup></a>\n    In the painting, an African Magus\u2014recognizable not only because of his dark skin, but also marked by his prominent\n    forehead, pronounced jaw, and curly hair\u2014holds an elaborate red hat, decorated with jewels and two white plumes.\n    Here, the hat is the focus of the image; the feathers are attached to it solely as a decoration, in the fashion of\n    European hats. By contrast, in D\xfcrer\u2019s 1511 print, the multiple textured feathers are the visual focus of the hat\n    held by the African Magus. This figure shares the same high forehead, strong jaw, and short curly hair as the\n    painted figure, making him recognizably African despite his European garments, replete with slashed sleeves. A\n    17<sup>th</sup> century painting of the <i>Adoration of the Magi</i> by Juan Bautista Maino also includes an African\n    Magus whose headdress is overwhelmed by feathers (<a\n            href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Fray_Juan_Bautista_Maino_-_Adoration_of_the_Kings_-_WGA13870.jpg"\n            target="_blank">here</a>).<a\n            href="#strauss_edn27"\n            name="strauss_ednref27"\n            title=""><sup>[27]</sup></a> Though Maino\u2019s African king appears to have a turban wrapped around his head,\n    the white band of fabric is fairly narrow, and crowned by brightly-colored feathers, like those described by\n    Europeans visiting the New World.<a\n            href="#strauss_edn28"\n            name="strauss_ednref28"\n            title=""><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>\n\n<p>These final examples serve also to illustrate the difficulty of finding recognizably \u201cAmerican\u201d figures in early\n    modern depictions of the Magi. At most, they mark isolated instances in which New World iconography is adduced to\n    other figures. While it could be worth interrogating whether Far Eastern figures might have been understood by early\n    modern viewers as being \u201cAmerican\u201d\u2014as part of these newly discovered lands, where East and West meet, as they do on\n    the Vopel map\u2014there is no visual evidence to support this view. It thus is important to consider possible reasons\n    for this scarcity of New World references in depictions of the Magi. </p>\n\n<p>The lack of New World iconography in images of the Magi cannot be explained by arguing that Amerindian figures were\n    excluded because they were not known to the ancients living at the time of Christ, nor can it be rationalized as an\n    unacceptable departure from standard iconography. Antiquity was an important lens which Europeans used to understand\n    the New World, seeing the people they discovered as \u201cliving antiquities\u201d\u2014Holanda\u2019s theories are a key testament to\n    this worldview. Equally, the iconography of the Magi was clearly flexible: it shifted in the 15<sup>th</sup> century\n    to include the figure of an African Magus, and remained fluid in the 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> centuries.\n</p>\n\n<p>A more compelling\u2014though not comprehensive\u2014explanation may lie in the directionality of travel, which shaped European\n    understanding of the world. The Magi traveled from the East to reach the Christ Child, moving westward as they\n    followed the star that led them to Bethlehem. While it might be possible to sustain the reading that a New World\n    Magus could have traveled by a long land route westward, all of the Native Americans known to Europe had arrived\n    there from the west, by traveling eastward. Given the flexibility of travel of an African Magus, who would\n    necessarily have arrived in Bethlehem from the south, directionality does not seem to preclude a particular\n    geographic origin point; nevertheless, a travel-centric interpretation of the Magi could reasonably seem\n    incompatible with the people of the New World. </p>\n\n<p>On the whole, New World figures tend to appear in images of the Magi within specific contexts, in which their\n    presence plays a role in a larger theological or cosmographic paradigm. Given their rarity, American Magi cannot\n    simply be understood as another mode of conveying the \u201cexotic.\u201d Instead, they are best understood as precise and\n    contingent references. In early modern Europe\u2014a world of Mediterranean trade, Ottoman expansion, and the increasing\n    presence of African slaves\u2014representations of proximity seem to win out over distance. \xa0</p>\n\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><img width=342\n        height=551\n        src="strauss-images/image001.jpg"\n        align=left\n        hspace=12>\n</p>\n\n<p><b>Figure 1.

The origin of the word has a geographical nature: it derives from the Greek\n    <i>\u1f38</i><i>\u03bd\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 </i>(<i>India</i>)<i>, </i>which indicated the land of the Indus River (<i>Sindhu </i>in Sanskrit,\n    <i>Hindu</i> in Old Persian); the people inhabiting those regions were called <i>\u1f38</i><i>\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03af </i>(<i>Indoi</i>). In\n    its Latin form, <i>India</i> transmigrated into Italian vernaculars and was often used as an attribute for precious\n    goods, such as minerals and pigments.<a href="#riccio_edn1"\n                                            name="riccio_ednref1"\n                                            title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> The term was generally used as a toponym during\n    medieval times; however, the expansion of its meaning beyond geographical borders is not a phenomenon limited to the\n    16<sup>th</sup> century. Since Antiquity, in fact, India represented also an <i>other </i>place, a remote land\n    inhabited by monsters and bizarre creatures in the minds of the Ancient Greeks, or the location of Terrestrial\n    Paradise in the Middle Ages. These two extremes speak about a distance that is not only spatial, and that makes\n    India a fantastic repository of supernatural otherness. The traditional \u201cconfusion\u201d between India and Ethiopia\n    perfectly exemplifies this tendency.<a\n            href="#riccio_edn2"\n            name="riccio_ednref2"\n            title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a> \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 </p>\n<p>The discovery of the New World marks the beginning of a new life for \u2018<i>India\u2019; </i>the 16<sup>th</sup> century\n    represents, in fact, the apex of this longstanding philological disorder. It is well known how Christopher Columbus,\n    certain he had landed in Marco Polo\u2019s Orient, became the first player in a linguistic misunderstanding that still\n    persists today. A visual example can be observed in world maps and globes from the 16<sup>th</sup> century that\n    concretely show the ubiquity of India; in Caspar Vopel\u2019s World Map, for instance, we can find several <i>Indie</i>,\n    disseminated around Asia, America and Africa. It is important, however, to separate the historical \u201cerror\u201d from the\n    linguistic and cultural one; the former, resolved in a few decades with Vespucci\u2019s famed intuition, was only the\n    spark that gave life to the latter. </p>\n<p>The five editions of the <i>Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca</i> are the perfect tool to investigate this\n    evolution.

India is a synonym for Wealth and Abundance and, at the same\n    time, a remote land that is unquestionably different from us.

We will see, however, how this apparently\n    universal and fixed value is, indeed, more subtle, precise and variegated.</p>\n<p>The entry for \u2018<i>indiano\u2019</i> provides interesting material as well:\xa0 </p>\n<p><b>INDIANO</b>.

Curiously, the idiom stimulates a question that contains in itself\n    the first germs of the Amerasian problem: which <i>indiano</i> are we referring to? The reference to the na\xefvet\xe9\n    inevitably points at the Amerindians, but the \u2018faraway land\u2019 corresponds to the Indies, East or West we cannot know.\n</p>\n<p>One last observation on the <i>Vocabolario</i> regards chronology. The entries discussed above only appear in the\n    fifth edition, published between 1843 and 1923, and they are still valid today. Therefore, we are discussing a\n    relatively recent definition, and this raises a series of questions on the use of the term in the 16<sup>th</sup>\n    century and the origin of the insightful description that we find in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. The only obvious\n    mention of India, present since the first edition of 1612, is the term \u2018<i>indico\u2019<a href="#riccio_edn7"\n                                                                                         name="riccio_ednref7"\n                                                                                         title=""><sup>[7]</sup></a></i>.\n<p>This eloquent absence, however, is not translated into an equivalent silence: \u2018<i>India\u2019 </i>and \u2018<i>indiano\u2019 </i>populate\n    the vocabulary, infiltrating the definitions of many terms, from \u2018<i>gallo</i>\u2019 to \u2018<i>pepe</i>\u2019, to \u2018<i>caldo</i>\u2019\n    and \u2018<i>tamarindi</i>\u2019. The occurrence of such attributes, moreover, multiplies from one publication to the other,\n    to the extreme cases of \u2018<i>poleggio\u2019 </i>and \u2018<i>porcellino</i>\u2019, in which reference to India appears only in the\n    fourth edition (1729-38) and is supplemented by a rather longer definition. The use of India as an attribute is a\n    clear allusion to the ideas of abundance and distance and it refers, at the same time, to the various historical\n    conception related to it. The natural abundance of the Garden of Eden, for instance, or the tales of mythical reigns\n    refulgent of gold and silver<a href="#riccio_edn8"\n                                   name="riccio_ednref8"\n                                   title=""><sup>[8]</sup></a> could have explained, in the Western mind, the profusion\n    of products flooding the European markets. (On the mapping of Paradise, <a href="/chang-paradise">see the entry by\n        Edward Chang</a>) It is not surprising, then, that the nomenclature <i>\u2018d\u2019India\u2019 </i>or <i>\u2018delle Indie</i>\u2019 was\n    applied to plants, fruits, animals and luxury goods, especially if we consider the mercantile culture of the Italian\n    peninsula, whose contacts with the East were mainly commercial. After 1492, the arrival of American goods in Europe\n    encountered this sort of mentality, which resulted in an extension of the nomenclature to these new products.\n    Whether West or East Indies, these goods were coming from distant countries and therefore their cost was higher; in\n    this sense, \u2018<i>indiano</i>\u2019 acquires a further semantic level, denoting more generally things with a non-European\n    provenance, or \u2018exotic\u2019. </p>\n<p>A perfect example of the various uses of \u2018<i>India\u2019</i> and \u2019<i>indiano\u2019 </i>is Giorgio Vasari. The first meaning we\n    encounter is the simplest one: reminiscent of medieval writers and contemporary merchants, he uses the attribute\n    \u2018<i>d\u2019India\u2019 </i>or \u2018<i>indiano\u2019</i> in reference to animals.<a href="#riccio_edn9"\n                                                                    name="riccio_ednref9"\n                                                                    title=""><sup>[9]</sup></a> In other cases, Vasari\n    indeed refers to the continent America, therefore using <i>\u2018Indie\u2019 </i>with a precise geographical intent. </p>\n<p>One example of this is the description of the Guardaroba in Palazzo Vecchio, where Ignazio Danti painted <i>le tavole\n    di Tolomeo misurate perfettamente tutte, e ricorrette secondo gli autori nuovi e con le carte giuste delle\n    navigazioni, con somma diligenzia fatte le scale loro da misurare, et i gradi dove sono in quelle, e\u2019 nomi antichi e\n    moderni.</i><a\n        href="#riccio_edn10"\n        name="riccio_ednref10"\n        title=""><sup>[10]</sup></a>&nbsp;The tables accurately described by Vasari depict the known world, which, he\n    tells us, is divided in four equal parts: Europe, Africa, Asia and the West Indies.<a\n            href="#riccio_edn11"\n            name="riccio_ednref11"\n            title=""><sup>[11]</sup></a> The Indies are mentioned again in relation to the portrait of Amerigo Vespucci\n    <i>che fece le navigazioni delle Indie</i><a href="#riccio_edn12"\n                                                 name="riccio_ednref12"\n                                                 title=""><sup>[12]</sup></i></a> and one last time in the description\n    of the Palazzo degli Spini, in Florence:</p>\n<p><i>Ma ritornando allo spazio della facciata che svolgendo al palazzo degli Spini s\'appoggiava, si vedeva di chiaro\n    oscuro dipinta in esso una Ninfa tutta inculta e poco meno che ignuda, in mez[z]o a molti nuovi animali: et era\n    questa presa per la nuova terra del Per\xf9, con l\'altre nuove Indie Occidentali, sotto gl\'auspizii della\n    fortunatissima Casa d\'Austria.</i><a\n            href="#riccio_edn13"\n            name="riccio_ednref13"\n            title=""><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>\n<p>The recognition of the existence of a fourth part of the world, equal and separated from the other continents, does\n    not stop Vasari from using the word \u2018<i>indiano\u2019</i> in and ambiguous and fluid manner, sometimes as a mere\n    signifier for \u2018exotic\u2019 or \u2018foreign\u2019, sometimes charged with deeper meanings.

The painting, commissioned by the friars of San Donato Scopeto,\n    illustrates the Augustinian tradition, specifically the <i>Homilies </i>of Saint Augustine. According to the text,\n    on that day Christ was offered to the adoration of pagans, alluding to his mission as the Savior of all the people\n    of the world. The crowded scene is filled with Indians, Moors and bizarre costumes<a href="#riccio_edn14"\n                                                                                         name="riccio_ednref14"\n                                                                                         title=""><sup>[14]</sup></a>,\n    an expedient through which Lippi illustrates the <i>Homilies</i> and Vasari narrates them; turbans and camels,\n    pearls and sandals in the painting have the same value that the words \u2018<i>indiani</i>\u2019 and \u2018<i>Mori\u2019 </i>have in the\n    text. (For an essay on the Magi in the context of the New World discoveries, <a\n            href="#strauss-magi">see the essay by Scarlett H.

The choice of these words poses a problem:\n    why is Vasari referring to this figure as \u2018Indian\u2019? The man is seen from the back, his face is not visible;\n    apparently there is nothing that would explain this unusual characterization. A closer observation, however, will\n    offer some details that could clarify the problem. The figure is wearing pants, traditionally associated with an\n    Oriental or Barbaric fashion (especially in an Ancient Roman setting); the mention of the yellow cloak could provide\n    another explanation if we read it as a reference to the pigment <i>giallo indiano</i>. All these reasons, however,\n    seem feeble, especially if we consider that the scene represents Caesar receiving a tribute from foreign\n    ambassadors,<a href="#riccio_edn16"\n                   name="riccio_ednref16"\n                   title=""><sup>[16]</sup></a> therefore justifying the presence of not one, but many, \u201cIndians.\u201d The\n    text could help us understand: Vasari describes the figure focusing the attention on two elements: the yellow cloak\n    and the cage with parrots that he is carrying. (On parrots, <a\n            href="/lipsman-parrots">see the entry by Claire Lipsman</a>.) The cage is filled with numerous birds, most\n    likely coming from different parts of the globe, and is crowned by a magnificent, brightly colored specimen.\n    Although not depicted from life, the disposition and color of the feathers and the form of the beak seem to suggest\n    an identification with the Scarlet Macaw (Ara Macao), native to the Amazon region. The inclusion of an unmistakably\n    American parrot reveals that Andrea Del Sarto deliberately chose to reference the New World in this work in order to\n    show that people from every corner of the Earth, even from the most remote ones, came to pay tribute to Caesar, and\n    metaphorically to the Medici.<a href="#riccio_edn17"\n                                    name="riccio_ednref17"\n                                    title=""><sup>[17]</sup></a> The placement of the figure on the extreme left of the\n    fresco, just as the Americas were \u201cplaced\u201d on the extreme \u201cleft\u201d of Europe, seems to confirm this hypothesis. It is\n    important to note that Del Sarto\u2019s work on painting the scene does not extend beyond the figure of Caesar; the right\n    side of the fresco was completed in 1585 by Alessandro Allori. The later addition perhaps altered the balance of the\n    original composition, enclosed between two very well-defined extremes: almost Columns of Hercules, the \u2018<i>figura\n        indiana</i>\u2019 and Caesar serve as pillars; the New World on one side, open and unknown, and, on the other side,\n    the embodiment of Rome , the classical center of the world, ideally replaced by Florence in the Renaissance. This\n    symbolic system is perfectly understood by Vasari, who participates in the iconographical game by calling the figure\n    \u2018Indian\u2019.\xa0 </p>\n<p>Other 16<sup>th</sup> century authors, such as Ariosto and Tasso, follow a similar trend. The <i>Orlando Furioso </i>and\n    the <i>Gerusalemme Liberata</i> represent two more examples of the problem of awareness. In canto 15 of the <i>Orlando</i>,\n    in a tribute to Charles V and his global empire, Ariosto elevates Cort\xe9s to immortal glory and, in an epic parallel,\n    Tasso uses his own canto 15 to honor Columbus as one of the most illustrious men of his time. The grand encomia paid\n    to the protagonists of the age of exploration prove the interest of Italian intellectuals in the matters of the New\n    World, but the disjunction of historical events and linguistic tendencies is evident in their use of the word \u2018<i>indiano.</i>\u2019\n    Tasso\u2019s narration, in particular, is set in an era which could have not been further from the problem of India, and\n    yet he celebrates Columbus, while referring to Muslim generals and knights as \u2018<i>indiano</i>\u2019. The word here is a\n    synonym of infidel, but in the great praise paid to the courage of the \u2018<i>fero indio\u2019<a href="#riccio_edn18"\n                                                                                             name="riccio_ednref18"\n                                                                                             title=""><sup>[18]</sup></a></i>\n    Adrasto it is free of any negative connotation. </p>\n<p>Along the same lines, 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> century inventories of Venetian, Bolognese and Florentine\n    collections confirm the historical-philological incoherence and the persistence of the idea of Amerasia in the\n    Italian language. In the inventories of the Medici collection, for instance, the terms \u2018<i>indiano</i>\u2019, \u2018<i>all\u2019indiana\u2019,\n        \u2018dell\u2019India\u2019 </i>were alternatively used to denote objects from America, Asia, Africa, thus encompassing many\n    things exotic or foreign. Mixtec masks \u2018<i>all\u2019indiana</i>\u2019, feather robes \u2018<i>dell\u2019India</i>\u2019 were displayed\n    together with Asian artifacts in Cosimo\u2019s Guardaroba, the same one described by Vasari as a representation of the\n    whole world. The same happens in Bolognese and Venetian collections, from the case of Ulisse Aldovrandi and his\n    indiscriminate use of Indian and American terms, to the mention of \u2018<i>una lucerta sive altro animale dell\u2019America\n        parte del mondo novamente ritrovata\u2019</i><a href="#riccio_edn19"\n                                                   name="riccio_ednref19"\n                                                   title=""><sup>[19]</sup></a><i> </i>used in combination with \u2018<i>indiano\u2019 </i>or\n    \u2018<i>delle Indie\u2019 </i>in the <i>Inventario </i>of Andrea Mantova Benavides (1695). (On the Florentine Codex owned by\n    Ferdinando I de Medici, <a href="/raitt-florentinecodex">see the entry by Louisa Raitt</a>.) </p>\n<p>To observe the occurrence of this phenomenon in visual arts, we can turn to Germany. Albrecht Altdorfer\u2019s <i>Christ\n    Crowned with Thorns</i> (1518), part of the <i>Saint Sebastian Altar, </i>is a parallel to Vasari\u2019s textual fluidity\n    in the realm of images. The background of the painting shows a secondary scene,<a href="#riccio_edn20"\n                                                                                      name="riccio_ednref20"\n                                                                                      title=""><sup>[20]</sup></a>\n    characterized by the odd presence of a figure that can be easily identified as an Amerindian, from the feather\n    headdress to the partial nudity and the club resting on his shoulder. The presence of this Indian, at first rather\n    bizarre, could be explained by the fact that the scene is set in the Holy Land, a place east of Europe, and it\n    represents episodes from the Passion of Christ. A character native to the most remote place on Earth, possibly pagan\n    and infidel, could help us put a distance between our Christian Europe and the barbarous actions perpetrated against\n    Christ. Altdorfer is also an interesting figure, since his case shares many similarities with Vasari\u2019s. Both artists\n    worked in an environment strongly fascinated with the New World: in Florence, the Medici were collecting American\n    artefacts, just as was happening in Augsburg. The Florentine infatuation with the Americas developed during the\n    course of the 16<sup>th</sup> century, taking the form of Ludovico Buti\u2019s frescoes in the Uffizi, or that of the\n    Thornton expedition in the 17<sup>th</sup> century. (On the Buti frescoes, <a\n            href="#weitzman-armeria">see the essay Margo Weitzman</a>.)The Northern artists did not remain indifferent:\n    the interest of artists such as D\xfcrer and Burkmair (part of the same circle of Altdorfer) is evident in their\n    drawings and illustrations, and the <i>Triumph of Maximilian I</i> (1518) could be considered the final phase of the\n    evolution of this interest. The <a\n            href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/431769" target="_blank">People of Calicut</a>, part of the procession\n    in honor of the Emperor in the <i>Triumphs,</i> are the representation of this culture of exchanges, symbolizing at\n    the same time the notions of extremities and fusion in a propagandistic and celebratory context. Expressly depicting\n    Asian populations,<a href="#riccio_edn21"\n                         name="riccio_ednref21"\n                         title=""><sup>[21]</sup></a> they are characterized by a mixture of feather headdresses,\n    Brazilian clubs and elephants, becoming the perfect embodiment of this combination of Asia and America, historical\n    awareness and linguistic neglect. </p>\n<p>In conclusion, \u2018<i>indiano</i>\u2019 and <i>\u2018India</i>\u2019 were extremely ambiguous terms in the sixteenth and\n    seventeenth centuries. They could acquire positive connotations or negative meanings, allude to distant and wealthy\n    lands while hinting at familiar notions; they could refer to infidel savages and at the same time denote precious\n    and luxurious product. The continuous use of these words in an undefined and malleable manner perfectly shows how,\n    after more than five centuries, the mentality of Amerasia survives in our everyday language. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<div id=edn1>\n\n    <p><a href="#riccio_ednref1"\n          name="riccio_edn1"\n          title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> See Dante, Purg.VII.74. <i>Oro e argento fine, e cocco, e biacca, indico legno\n        lucido, e sereno</i>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=edn2>\n    <p><a href="#riccio_ednref2"\n          name="riccio_edn2"\n          title=""><sup>[2]</sup> </a>From a linguistic point of view, Dante provides a helpful example. Purg.VII.74\n        poses a series of problems of interpretation. Scholars usually identify <i>indico </i>with <i>indaco</i> (the\n        blue pigment), but some propose that the words <i>indico</i> and <i>legno</i> should be read together, therefore\n        indicating ebony (see Virgil, <i>Sola India nigrum fert hebanum</i>, Georg.II). Ebony is a type of wood typical\n        of Ethiopia, as well as Asian regions such as Indochina and Sri Lanka. If we accept the second interpretation,\n        this could exemplify the persistence of an India-Ethiopia overlap in the languages of 12th century Italy.

In the region of the map\n    labelled Hispania Nova (New Spain), we find Temixtitan (Tenochtitlan, Mexico City) due east of Mangi (Manzi, or\n    Southern China) and southeast of Chatay (Cathay, or Northern China), with a Messigo (Mexico) to the west of Mangi\n    and a smattering of cities ending in <i>fu</i> (a Chinese administrative division signifying \u201cprefecture\u201d) in the\n    same general region as identifiably Mesoamerican place names like Aculuacan (Acolhuacan), all within the lands of\n    Asia Magna (Greater Asia) and bordered on the east by what is now known as the Gulf of Mexico but that here is\n    labelled Mare Cathayum (\u201cSea of Cathay\u201d). Vopel\u2019s assertive amalgamation of the newly discovered territories with\n    legendary Asian sites may reflect his interest in promoting the idea that Chinese lands fell well within the\n    territories of the Spanish Crown, as opposed to those of Portugal, a notion reinforced by his claim to that effect\n    in one of the explanatory cartouches that identifies Moctezuma, the ruler of Tenochtitlan, with the Great Khan\n    (\u201cThemixitian magni Chan Imperatoris alias Montis Zuma\u201d).<a href="#_edn1"\n                                                                name="_ednref1"\n                                                                title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Regardless of Vopel\u2019s geopolitical thesis, it is worth considering whether his contemporaries would find\n    this imbrication of China and Mexico as jarring as it is to us. How could these disparate regions and cultures be so\n    closely drawn together in his geographic imaginary that they effectively overlapped?

Yet despite the watery divide of the Pacific\n    and the scrupulous cataloguer\u2019s plausible desire for precision, it is nevertheless still possible that he and others\n    who consulted the <i>Codex Cospi</i> did not conceive of that division as impeding some fundamental cultural\n    connection between (our) East Asia and Mesoamerica.</p>\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 In his account of language and knowledge in Europe before the Age of Reason in the second chapter of <i>The\n    Order of Things</i>, Michel Foucault describes how the principle of resemblance subtended the interpretation of\n    texts and the world in their interpenetrating relationship, highlighting four kinds of similitude in particular: <i>convenientia</i>\n    (a \u201ccoming together\u201d), expressing the adjacency of things in the great chain of being; <i>aemulatio</i>, or\n    similarity between things that are not contiguous on that chain; <i>analogia</i>, a kind of superimposition of <i>convenientia</i>\n    and <i>aemulatio</i>, which refers to analogous relationships between sets of things; and, finally, <i>sympathia</i>,\n    which (for example) governs the movement of the four elements or the physiological humors and involves a\n    transformative displacement of qualities between things that are drawn together because of their supposed\n    affinities.<a href="#_edn7"\n                  name="_ednref7"\n                  title=""><sup>[7]</sup></a> All of these categories involve, in one form or another, an\n    epistemological process of <i>assimilation</i>: ascribing similar qualities to otherwise different things.\n    Strikingly, though his textual sources in this chapter postdate the Transatlantic encounter between Europe and the\n    Americas, Foucault does not delve into the implications of this event, which could surely have tested European\n    epistemologies founded on the principle of resemblances and provided one initial basis for the epistemic shift that\n    he situates in the Age of Reason. Though one may lament Foucault\u2019s having missed an opportunity to explore the\n    intellectual ramifications of European exploration and colonization in Africa, Asia and the Americas, his omission\n    is perhaps not entirely surprising, given the concerted efforts European thinkers made during the two centuries\n    after Columbus\u2019s voyages to assimilate a \u201cnew world\u201d into the preexisting hermeneutic schemas that had developed as\n    part of the complex architecture of late medieval and early modern epistemologies.</p>\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The present essay considers one instance of such an assimilation\u2014one that is tied to the domain of books\n    and writing, which, as Foucault points out, was privileged over orality in pre- and early modern\n    epistemologies.<a href="#_edn8"\n                      name="_ednref8"\n                      title=""><sup>[8]</sup></a> The European reception and interpretation of the few surviving\n    pre-Columbian indigenous manuscripts and of pictographic writing and illustrations in post-conquest codices prepared\n    under the watchful eye of missionaries reflects this primacy of the written word and encouraged the incorporation of\n    indigenous American writing systems within a larger narrative of the Biblical \u201cconfusion of tongues\u201d in the episode\n    of the Tower of Babel, with <i>written</i> words understood to be the underlying form of language, and all writing,\n    however far removed from its origins before Babel, darkly mirroring the words in the \u201cbook of Creation.\u201d Attempts to\n    understand Mesoamerican manuscripts can be tied to two intellectual currents, both of which emerged out of\n    traditions of esotericism: on the one hand, the images found in emblem books and, on the other, inquiries into the\n    history of human languages. Both currents informed European scholars\u2019 interest in Egyptian hieroglyphs and other\n    written manifestations of ancient languages; both are tied to a fundamentally visual or scriptural conception of\n    language as a mysterious chain of resemblances linking words to things; both depend on allegorical modes of thought\n    according to which a single image can encompass a complex statement.</p>\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Europeans who scrutinized these Mesoamerican manuscripts evidently understood the images and pictographs\n    to be \u201chieroglyphs\u201d\u2014a not unreasonable supposition\u2014though what exactly was meant by this term deserves some\n    unpacking, especially because they seem to have interpreted not just the pictographs proper as hieroglyphs but also\n    what are in fact images of deities and rulers. The term itself emerged in the context of the discovery in 1419 of a\n    treatise from late Antiquity on Egyptian symbolic writing, the <i>Hieroglyphica</i> attributed to a certain\n    Horapollo (a Hellenized compound of Horus Apollo), and the circulation of that text among Italian humanists in the\n    fifteenth century. Renaissance fascination with Egyptian monumental inscriptions was further encouraged by the\n    contemporary excavation in Rome of sculptures and obelisks bearing hieroglyphics.<a href="#_edn9"\n                                                                                        name="_ednref9"\n                                                                                        title=""><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Though Horapollo was no Rosetta Stone, and Europeans remained fundamentally in the dark regarding\n    Egyptian writing until 1799, speculation on the meaning of such inscriptions led to inventive \u201chieroglyphs\u201d of the\n    sort that appear in Francesco Colonna\u2019s <i>Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</i> (Venice, 1499), like the famous emblem that\n    its printer, Aldus Manutius, adopted as his own device and motto, the dolphin-entwined anchor signifying \u201cfestina\n    tarde\u201d (or \u201clente,\u201d hasten slowly), paired with another emblem, a helmet, an ox-skull, and an oil lamp representing\n    the idea that \u201cPatience is the ornament, guardian and protector of life\u201d [fig. 2]. A rough genealogy may be drawn\n    from Colonna through Andrea Alciato\u2019s moralizing interpretations of emblems in his <i>Emblematum liber</i>\n    (Augsburg, 1531) and Pierio Valeriano\u2019s voluminous exegesis of allegorical figures based on commentaries on\n    Horapollo, <i>Hieroglyphica sive de sacris Aegyptiorum literis commentarii</i> (Basel, 1556), to the most emblematic\n    of emblem books, Cesare Ripa\u2019s <i>Iconologia</i>, published initially without illustrations in Rome in 1593 but soon\n    reissued in 1603 with a substantial catalogue of accompanying woodcuts whose number continued to grow in two\n    subsequent re-editions before the author\u2019s death in 1622 [figs. 3-5]. Each of these books present complex images\n    that today could never be confused with hieroglyphs, though the title of Valeriano\u2019s work makes it clear that the\n    term could be plausibly applied to such images in the sixteenth century. Each emblem, furthermore, is accompanied by\n    elaborate exegeses suggesting that, in accordance with the contemporary understanding of Egyptian hieroglyphs, the\n    images themselves were shorthand for entire complexes of ideas.</p>\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 In this light, Lorenzo Legati\u2019s attempt in the expanded catalogue of the Cospi collection at\n    understanding the images and pictographs in the <i>Codex Cospi</i>\u2014if not their semantic content, at least their\n    function\u2014becomes clearer. His description of the manuscript, following an account of its size and accordion-book\n    format (\u201cnon \xe8 diviso in fogli, come i nostri libri\u201d\u2014it is not divided into leaves, like our books), indicates that\n    the book contains \u201conly HIEROGLYPHS from MEXICO, which are very extravagant figures that for the most part portray\n    strangely monstrous humans and animals\u201d [fig. 6].<a href="#_edn10"\n                                                        name="_ednref10"\n                                                        title=""><sup>[10]</sup></a> These he divides into various\n    categories, by size: \u201cmassimi,\u201d \u201cmediocri,\u201d \u201cmenori,\u201d and \u201cminimi.\u201d The penultimate class are arranged in \u201cmarginal\n    compartments, as if they were (and perhaps they are) marginal notes or commentary on the larger hieroglyphs,\u201d and\n    the last \u201clikewise seem to explain the largest hieroglyphs, which they surround like a crown.\u201d<a href="#_edn11"\n                                                                                                     name="_ednref11"\n                                                                                                     title=""><sup>[11]</sup></a>\n    Though Legati fails to find an analogous book form for the manuscript, he does intuit an analogy for the small\n    pictographs around the margins (marginal notes or commentaries) and situates the pictographs and illustrations in\n    the general category of hieroglyphs, presumably on an Egyptian model\u2014or, rather, on a model that encompassed also\n    the elaborate allegories in emblem books, conflating those figures with Egyptian hieroglyphs as they were understood\n    by European savants. The examples he provides include an image of the Lord of the House of Dawn,\n    Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli (the planet Venus), and a throne, both <i>geroglifici massimi</i> in Legati\u2019s classification.\n    The woodcut in the catalogue fails, however, to reflect the fact that this image is a narrative scene in the\n    original manuscript, with the fearsome god attacking the throne with his spear. In Legati\u2019s catalogue, the figure\n    has been reversed, suggesting that he has interpreted each element as a separate \u201chieroglyph\u201d [fig. 7; cf. fig. 8].\n</p>\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The description of the \u201cMexican book\u201d appears in the second chapter of the third book of Legati\u2019s full\n    catalogue of the Cospi collection, under the rubric of\xa0 \u201cLibri, Volume, Carte, e Scritture Esotiche\u201d (Books,\n    volumes, documents, and esoteric writings). Here there are various books and ink drawings from China (immediately\n    preceding our erstwhile \u201cChinese\u201d book, now catalogued as \u201cMexican\u201d). Legati refers to Chinese characters as such\n    (<i>caratteri</i>) and not as hieroglyphs, but he does cite at length the humanist and historiographer Cosimo\n    Bartoli (1503\u20131572), who, after explaining that each character represents a word and that they would be better\n    described as \u201ccifere\u201d (ciphers), compares Chinese characters to Egyptian hieroglyphs: they are \u201cingenious work,\n    perhaps even more witty than Egyptian hieroglyphs.\u201d<a href="#_edn12"\n                                                          name="_ednref12"\n                                                          title=""><sup>[12]</sup></a> Legati notes that the Chinese\n    write with a brush, not a pen, something he also draws our attention to in the description of the Mexican book:\n    \u201cfatture non della Penna, m\xe0 del Pennello.\u201d<a href="#_edn13"\n                                                  name="_ednref13"\n                                                  title=""><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We lack even an approximate date for the creation of the <i>Codex Cospi</i>, but the style of the images\n    and pictographs as well as the book\u2019s folded format reflect a decidedly pre-Columbian tradition, even if it might\n    have been prepared during the early years of the conquest of Mexico.<a href="#_edn14"\n                                                                           name="_ednref14"\n                                                                           title=""><sup>[14]</sup></a> Following the\n    conquest, missionaries working in the Spanish colonies oversaw the production of newfangled books by indigenous\n    informants, scribes, and painters\u2014European-style codices proper, with hinges at the spine\u2014whose imagery likewise\n    reflected the influence of European draftsmanship while conserving fundamental aspects of Mesoamerican pictographic\n    conventions. One such document is the so-called <i>Codex Mendoza</i>, perhaps commissioned by the first viceroy of\n    New Spain, Antonio de Mendoza (thus its conventional name) and in all likelihood prepared during his administration\n    (1535\u20131550). It represents in its first pages a pictorial history of the founding of Tenochtitl\xe1n and the reign of\n    its first ruler, followed by an accounting of the tributes from conquered territories paid to the Mexica rulers of\n    that city [fig. 9]. The last page of the manuscript explains that it was intended to be sent on to Spain. It somehow\n    came into the possession of Andr\xe9 Thevet, appointed royal cosmographer to Henri II of France around 1553, and his\n    signature appears in several places on the manuscript.<a href="#_edn15"\n                                                             name="_ednref15"\n                                                             title=""><sup>[15]</sup></a> Thevet referred to\n    Mesoamerican books in his possession in his own writings and did not hesitate to compare the pictographs and figures\n    with Egyptian hieroglyphs, though he wavers in his terminology, also recalling Legati\u2019s description of Chinese\n    writing:</p>\n<blockquote>the Mexicans, in order to express their ideas, use characters resembling diverse terrestrial and aquatic\n    animals and the head, feet, arms, and other limbs of a man, just as the Egyptians and Ethiopians did formerly in\n    their hieroglyphic letters\u2026. Two such books I have by me, written by hand in the city of Themistitan, and filled\n    with their characters and figures and the interpretations of them.<a href="#_edn16"\n                                                                         name="_ednref16"\n                                                                         title=""><sup>[16]</sup></a></blockquote>\n\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 When Thevet died, Richard Hakluyt acquired the manuscript, and upon his passing bequeathed it to Samuel\n    Purchas, who published a woodcut reproduction of fol. 2 in his <i>Hakluytus posthumus, or, Purchas his Pilgrimes</i>\n    (London, 1625) [fig. 10]. This image was in turn copied in a work that brings us full circle, back to the\n    esotericism of Renaissance exegetes of <i>emblemata</i>, hieroglyphs, and Hermetic and Kabbalistic texts (and to the\n    logic of Foucault\u2019s episteme founded on the principle of similitudes), with the figure of the Jesuit polymath\n    Athanasius Kircher, the <i>summum</i> of that tradition as it had developed in the seventeenth century and perhaps\n    also its last gasp.</p>\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Kircher included the copy of Purchas\u2019s woodcut of the <i>Codex Mendoza</i> in the last volume of his <i>Oedipus\n    Aegyptiacus</i> (Rome, 1652\u201354) [fig. 11]. This work was the culmination of his studies in ancient languages leading\n    to his fanciful and quasi-mystical interpretation of Egyptian hieroglyphics and a reaffirmation of his thesis that\n    Egyptian writing (and wisdom and religion) provided the ancient foundations for that of the Indians, the East Asians\n    and even the Americans, however distorted and debased that original writing and wisdom had become through the\n    process of its dissemination in Antiquity. Or, as he put it in the work where he first formulated the thesis\n    extensively, <i>Prodromus Coptus sive Aegyptiacus</i> (Coptic or Egyptian Precursor), published in Rome in 1636,\n    \u201cEgypt was the nursery not only of the progress of the Christian religion in distant lands, but also of all the\n    superstitions propagated to the world at every time.\u201d<a href="#_edn17"\n                                                            name="_ednref17"\n                                                            title=""><sup>[17]</sup></a> The Apostles, in spreading the\n    gospel of Christ throughout the world, had simply followed the same routes taken by the priests of ancient Egypt.\n    Kircher\u2019s vision of language, history, and theology entails some fundamental affinity or similarity spanning a vast\n    swath of lands and peoples, from North Africa, across Asia, and into the Americas: \u201cIndia\u201d writ large, in other\n    words, from the \u201cIndia Maior Aethiopiae\u201d (Greater India of Ethiopia) on Vopel\u2019s map, through \u201cIndia intra Gangem\u201d\n    and \u201cIndia extra Gangem,\u201d all the way to \u201cIndia Orientalis\u201d and the lands of the Mexica. Even if maps included in\n    Kircher\u2019s publications depict a wide Pacific Ocean (or <i>Mare Australe</i>) and a strait between eastern Siberia\n    and Alaska, conceptually at least these territories were effectively contiguous.</p>\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thus, while Mexican temples might lend themselves to easy comparison with Egyptian pyramids, as in\n    Kircher\u2019s discussion of the temple of Huitzilopochtli in a chapter of <i>Oedipus Aegyptiacus</i> titled \u201cDe\n    religione Americanorum Aegyptiacae parallela\u201d (On the religion of the Americans, a parallel of the Egyptian) [fig.\n    12], Asian pagodas do not. Nevertheless, he presents them as \u201cpyramids\u201d as well in his <i>China illustrata</i>\n    (Amsterdam, 1667) and correspondingly distorts their representation to confirm their allegedly Egyptian origin and\n    thereby supply further evidence for the Egyptian roots of Chinese religion [fig. 13].<a\n            href="#_edn18"\n            name="_ednref18"\n            title=""><sup>[18]</sup></a> Kircher makes a similar move in his treatment of Asian writing systems. In the\n    series of encomia to Ferdinand III of Austria composed in dozens of different languages and scripts at the beginning\n    of <i>Oedipus Aegyptiacus</i>, Kircher includes one purporting to be in Brahmi script, which he calls \u201clingua\n    hieroglyphica Brachmanum\u201d (hieroglyphic language of the Brahmans). And the origin of Chinese characters, or <i>characteres\n        hieroglyphici Sinensium</i>, is likewise Egyptian according to his <i>China illustrata</i>: \u201cThe ancient\n    Chinese\u2026followed the Egyptians, from whom they are descended: they executed their writing not by a composition of\n    letters but by figures constructed from various natural things,\u201d such as the characters he claims are derived from\n    images of birds [fig. 14].<a href="#_edn19"\n                                 name="_ednref19"\n                                 title=""><sup>[19]</sup></a> In any case, Kircher explicitly states his overarching\n    thesis at the very beginning of this section of <i>China illustrata</i>, \u201cDe Sinensium literatura\u201d (On Chinese\n    literature), regarding the peoples of the world who use non-alphabetic writing systems, or <i>characteres\n        significativi</i>: \u201cIt is certain that three nations, before all other peoples of the world, made use of these\n    [characters], namely, the Chinese, the Brahmans, and the Mexicans.\u201d<a\n            href="#_edn20"\n            name="_ednref20"\n            title=""><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 However much the accuracy of seventeenth-century maps had improved over Vopel\u2019s vision of the world,\n    Kircher\u2019s works suggest that, in certain corners at least, the underlying principles behind Vopel\u2019s organization of\n    geography remained in force. Asia and America might well have become clearly delineated continents, but they were\n    part of a world in which the dream of recovering a universal, Adamic language\u2014one that preserved a direct\n    correspondence between words and things\u2014was still conceivable, for its traces were retrievable in the visual echoes\n    of the scripts of ancient and modern languages. This is the ethos evoked in an engraving by Zacharias Dolendo after\n    a design by Karel van Mander printed in the last years of the sixteenth century depicting the confusion of tongues\n    and peoples after work stopped on the Tower of Babel [fig. 15]. In the foreground, groups of figures carry or hold\n    three tablets, each bearing different alphabets, Hebrew, Greek, and Arabic. In the distance, hieroglyphics can be\n    made out faintly on an obelisk [fig. 16].<a href="#_edn21"\n                                                name="_ednref21"\n                                                title=""><sup>[21]</sup></a> Incongruously for a modern viewer, the\n    group with the Arabic tablet are naked save for loincloths and headdresses; one wears the stereotypical East Indian\n    or Amerindian feather headdress [fig. 17]. Is this an exercise in over-exuberant exoticism, in which truly no one is\n    \u201cat home,\u201d as Peter Mason might put it? Or is it an image of literal confusion, with Amerindians carrying off an\n    Arabic primer that will serve them no purpose\u2014perhaps like the man in an Ottoman turban who seems to struggle at\n    deciphering the Greek? Or could they be the \u201cAmerasian\u201d children of Shem about to head eastward towards what will be\n    their new home, Vopel\u2019s Asia Magna? \xa0</p>\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 </p>\n\n</div>\n<br clear=all>\n<hr align=left\n    size=1\n    width="33%">\n<div id=edn1>\n    <p><a href="#_ednref1"\n          name="_edn1"\n          title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> The cartouche quoted here is the introductory text to the reader, on the outer\n        edge of the central sheet on the far right of the map.
