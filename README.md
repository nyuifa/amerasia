This project was scaffolded using `create-react-app` (CRA).
Please refer to the [CRA docs](https://github.com/sagar-sm/ifa-amerasia/blob/master/config/README.md) here for additional instructions.

## Setup guide

### Running the app locally

1. [Download and install Node JS v10+](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your machine.

2. Clone or download this repository as a zip file.
    * For cloning, open the Terminal, `cd` into a directory of your choice (in our case the home folder on macOS: `cd ~`) and run <br/>
    `git clone https://github.com/sagar-sm/ifa-amerasia.git`
    * Alternatively you can also download the zip from Github and save it in a location of your choice.
    * For simplicity, this README file assumes that you have cloned or downloaded this 
repository in your home folder at `~/ifa-amerasia/`.

3. Running this app is easy,
    <br>In your terminal:
    * `cd ~/ifa-amerasia`: changes the directory to the location you've downloaded/cloned this repository.
    * `npm install`: reads the list of 3rd party libraries from file `package.json` and downloads them into a folder called `node_modules` 
    * `npm start`: Builds and starts the app at `localhost:3000` on a development server locally.
    * Visit [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app running.
    * Hit <kbd>Control + C</kbd> on your Terminal window to stop the development server.
    
### Editing/Writing new code
* It is strongly recommended that you use either [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) 
or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to write/edit code in this app.
 
* You can apply for a free education license for Webstorm [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/).
Visual Studio Code is free.

### Folder Structure
    
After successfully setting up, your project should look like this:

```
ifa-amerasia/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/              -> Public assets like images
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  config/
  scripts/
  build/               -> Contains built files to be uploaded to the server
  src/                 -> Contains all your code
    articles/          -> Contains all your headless HTML articles
    components/        -> Contains all the React components
      - NavBar.js      -> Code for navigation bar
      - MapPage.js     -> Code for main Map page/home paeg.
      - MapDebugPage.js-> Code for Debug Mode page
      - AboutPage.js
      - AccessibilityPage.js 
      - CreditsPage.js
      - SampleNewPage.js
    base.css           -> base css file
    data.js            -> file containing all the data points
    App.js         
    index.js
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

- `public/index.html` is the page template;
- `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

You can delete or rename the other files.

You may create subdirectories inside `src`. For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.<br>
You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, otherwise Webpack won’t see them.

Only files inside `public` can be used from `public/index.html`.
 
## Updating the data on the Map with debug mode

All the data that is displayed on your map is sourced from this file: [`src/data.js`](https://github.com/sagar-sm/ifa-amerasia/blob/master/src/data.js).
To update the data on your map, you will need to use the special debug mode page.
It can be found on `localhost:3000/#debug`. Don't forget the `#`.

You can use it to find the coordinates of the new data point you want to add.

Copy the point coordinates from the debug mode page and paste it in `data.js` as per the inline comments in that file, 
and edit other fields like title, html, id,  as per your liking. Here is the complete list of fields and their descriptions that are supported on each data item supports:
```javascript
{
  id: 'america',                            // This is the URL displayed in the address bar: localhost:3000/#america
  x: 0.469,                                 // Use the debug page to find the x coordinate of the point
  y: 0.302,                                 // Use the debug page to find the y coordinate of the point
  html: require('./articles/america.html'), // link to the HTML page in the articles directory
  title: 'Dumbo, Brooklyn',                 // Title to be displayed in search results
  keywords: 'Sample, list, of, keywords',   // Keywords to be used for search
},
```

> ⚠️ Please note that the `title` field here is the title that is displayed in the search results and not the one displayed on the page itself. The page is entirely loaded from the html template you provide. In order for a datum to show up in the search results you must define `title` and `keywords` on that datum.

To add new HTML articles, you should create an HTML file inside the `/articles` directory.
Within `data.js` you can refer to your newly created file as `require('./articles/asia.html')`.

Please note that the HTML article files need to be headless. 
i.e. without `<html>`, `<head>` or `<body>` tags. Take a look at the included sample articles for examples.


## Updating other pages
* You can directly change the content of `AboutPage.js` or `CreditsPage.js`.
The `return` value of the `render(){...}` function supports all valid HTML (JSX).
* Just make sure that you define classes on your HTML containers with 
the `className` propert instead of `class`.

```diff
- <div class="hello-world">...</div>      // incorrect
+ <div className="hello-world">...</div>  // correct ✅
```

* You can add reusable styles/class names within the base.css file.
* Additionally you can define specific styles as inline styles or by creating css files.
* If you create a new css file called `AboutPage.css` within `src/components` for some specific styles on `AboutPage.js`,
please be sure you import that file in `AboutPage.js` by adding this line at the top of the file
```
import './AboutPage.css'
```

## Adding new pages
* Copy paste an existing page like the `AboutPage.js`. 
* Rename the file to what you want. e.g. `MyNewPage.js`
* Rename the `class` definition, inside the file...
```js
export class MyNewPage exports React.Component {
  ...
}
``` 

### Adding new links to the navigation bar

Add the following for the desktop navigation bar with the other links:
```jsx
<Grid item>
  <Link to={'/my-new-page'} className={classes.navLink}>
    <Typography variant={'button'}>MY NEW PAGE</Typography>
  </Link>
</Grid>
```

Additionally, add the following for the mobile navigation menu with the other links:
```jsx
<Link to={'/my-new-page'} className={classes.navLink}>
  <MenuItem onClick={this.closeNavMenu}>
    <Typography variant={'button'}>MY NEW PAGE</Typography>
  </MenuItem>
</Link>
```

## Building and deploying
Run:
1. `cd ~/ifa-amerasia`  : or a directory location of your choice
2. `npm install`        : download and install all the libraries, if you haven't already
3. `npm run build`      : builds the app for production
4. Copy everything from the `/build` directory on to an FTP server of your choice. 

## Tiling and updating the map image

To tile an image you will have to install `sharp-cli` globally on your machine:<br>
`npm install sharp-cli -g`

This will download and install the [sharp](https://sharp.dimens.io/en/stable/) library on your machine.
You only have to do this **once** and not every time you want to tile an image.

> Note that the image resolution pixel limit for sharp is 268402689 (width * height) pixels. 
This resolution is sufficiently high for our map. If the image you are tiling is too large you might have to resize
so that image `width * height` is less than 268402689. You can do so using Photoshop, Preview or 
through the command line with `imagemagick`

`magick convert -resize 84% inputImage.jpg outputImage.jpg`

### Tile it!
To tile the image, 
1. `cd /directory/containing/your/large/image/`
2. `sharp tile 512 -i ImageName.jpg -o ./vopel`.
3. Copy the `/vopel` directory and the `vopel.dzi` generated by this command,
and paste it into the `public/map` folder of your app.
