<h1>Tartaria Magna</h1>

<p>
    Great Tartary was historically a territory located in northern and central
    Asia populated by Turkic peoples and Mongols; it stretched from the Caspian to
    the Pacific. It was often divided into regions held by different ruling
    powers, such as Muscovite Tartary, Cathay Tartary (Xinjiang and Mongolia,
    indicated on Vopel’s map just to the east of <em>Tartaria Magna</em>).
</p>

    One tribe of the Mongol confederacy bore the name Tatar, a word that for some
    Europeans recalled Tartarus, the hell of classical mythology. Especially after
    the passage of Mongol armies laid waste large parts of Central Asia in the
    middle of the thirteenth century, it became commonplace for the term Tatar or
    Tartar to stand in for the Mongols in general, as Europeans began referring to
    them as a kind of generic diabolical horde.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"

    When Polo uses the term Tartar, which he does regularly throughout his text,
    he is referring to the Mongols.

    The Tartars sometimes figured in Amerasian understandings of the world, often
    through rhetorics of similarity that likened them to New World peoples. For
    instance, In Michele de Cuneo’s letter to Hieronymo Annari, written in October
    of 1495 and describing Columbus’s second voyage in which Cuneo took part,
    Cuneo reported that the faces of Caribbean peoples “resemble a Tartar’s.”<a

    Similarly, the English explorer Martin Frobisher described the Inuit as “like
    Tartars.”<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a> Cornelis de Jode’s regional
    map of the Northwest Coast of America,
    <em>Quivirae Regnu cum alijs versus Borea</em>, from the second edition of his
    atlas <em>Speculum Orbis Terrae</em> (Antwerp, 1593), similarly equated the
    tents of the local population to those of the Tartars.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to such discussions about the similarities between Tartars and New
    World peoples, many in the New World imagined that the Tartars were not far
    away. For instance, the chronicler Fray Diego de Ocaña described a civic
    ritual that took place in Potosí in 1601 in which a figure dressed as the
    devil threw printed broadsheets to the crowd that proclaimed “the Prince of
    Tartary, who of sulphur/sustains himself in the dark cavern,/will present
    himself at half past five,/and he thanks those who shall suffer until then.”<a

        name="_ednref4"
>[4]</a
>
    While Potosiani may not have literally believed that the Prince of Tartary was
    hiding in a cave in a nearby valley, they nevertheless felt his presence. In
    his <em>New English Canaan</em> (1637) which described the indigenous peoples
    of Massachusetts, the colonist Thomas Morton acknowledged that “what part of
    this mane continente may be thought to border upon the country of the Tartars
    it is yet unknowne.”<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a> In Morton’s
    imaginary, the new pilgrim colonies in New England were founded on territory
    that might well extend into Great Tartary, an idea that was slow to die.
    Colonial writers such as James Adair and Jonathan Carver continued to discuss
    whether or not indigenous American tribes like the Chickasaw were descended
    from the Tartars until the end of the eighteenth century.<a
