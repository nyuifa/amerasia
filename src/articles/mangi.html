<h1>Mangi</h1>

<p>
    Mangi, or Manzi, was the derogatory term used by the Mongols and Marco Polo
    alike to describe the barbarians of Southern China. The toponym is commonplace
    on Amerasian maps (link to <a href="#wu-tangut-cathay-mangi">Wu essay</a>). On Vopel’s Map, Mexico is located in the
    Chinese kingdom of Cathay, and Chinese province of Mangi. According to the
    sixteenth-century Belgian cosmographer Franciscus Monachus, Mangi and Mexico
    were the same place, Mexico being the modern name for Mangi. Monachus argued
    that the medieval traveler Odoric of Pordenone made his way across mainland
    China and “came to the boundaries of Mansus [Mangi]. I think that presently
    the name is Messigo, as Ferdinand Cortes remembered it.”<a

    (link to <a href="#messigo">Messigo entry</a>) The Venetian polyglot Tomaso Garzoni believed that from
    the province of Mangi, going east, one soon arrived next in Labrador,
    illuminating the persistence of the idea of these connected continents in the
    second half of the sixteenth century.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a>
