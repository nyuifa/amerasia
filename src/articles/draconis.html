<h1>Draconis</h1>

<p>
    Off the coast of what is today Venezuela, Vopel has labeled the sea DRACONIS,
    referring to Columbus’s <em>Boca del Drago</em>, or “Mouth of the Dragon” to
    describe the tumultuous seas that churned around the delta of the mighty
    Orinoco River. During his third voyage in 1498, Columbus stood near this spot
    and reasoned that such a mighty river implied a great height inland, certainly
    the earthly paradise at the easternmost part of the earth.<a

    Similarly, in the so-called <em>Mundus novus</em> letter, published in 1502
    and purportedly authored by Amerigo Vespucci, Vespucci described the lands he
    visited in the western Atlantic, claiming that “certainly, if anywhere in the
    world there exists an Earthly Paradise, I think it is not far from these
    regions.”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a>
</p>
<p>
    Medieval historians, cosmographers, and cartographers regularly placed the
    Terrestrial Paradise somewhere in the East. John Mandeville for instance, who
    offered one of the most detailed descriptions of Paradise (and one that
    Columbus likely read) described it as an island “far to the east, beyond…the
    land of Prester John…at the very beginning of the world.”<a

    Mandeville reported having heard that Paradise was the highest region in the
    world, enclosed by a wall, with a spring discharging the Ganges, Nile, Tigris
    and Euphrates from its center.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a>
    Medieval <em>mappae mundi </em>also located Paradise in the East.<a
        href="#_edn5"

</p>
<p>
    These medieval understandings of directly informed how early modern explorers
    saw the Americas, who saw Asian lands in their voyages to the New World. If
    Paradise was in the East, and these explorers believed themselves to be close
    to its location, their understanding of the world therefore implied that the
    Americas overlapped with the lands of the Orient.
