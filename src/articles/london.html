    Richard Eden’s <em>A Treatyse of the Newe India</em>, published in London in
    1553, was the first printed English text to consider the voyages of Columbus
    and Vespucci, sixty years after they first occurred. By the time Eden published
    his <em>Treatyse</em>, European ideas about Amerasia had been developing in
    Europe for over fifty years. His text transmitted previously published
    Amerasian representations, in large part by including a translation of
    Sebastian Münster's <em>Cosmographia</em> (Basel, 1550), the first German
    language description of the world, which expressed a clear Amerasian
    understanding.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> Book Five of the
    <em>Cosmographia</em>, which Eden translated to form the body of his
    <em>Treatyse</em>, grouped Asia and America together as one unified part of
    the world, making America part of an archipelago that stretched from the
    Canaries to the Moluccas. (link to entry <a href="#archipelagus">Archipelagus</a>, and <a
