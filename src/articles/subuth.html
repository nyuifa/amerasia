<h1>Subuth</h1>

<p>
    Subuth on the Vopel map refers to Cebu, a city and province in the
    Philippines. The word is derived from the word <em>sibu</em>, meaning “trade”
    in the Austronesian language of Cebuano, still spoken in the Philippines
    today. The earliest documented European expedition to the Philippines was that
    led by Magellan (link to Magellan entry), who arrived in Cebu in 1521. Vopel
    tells us “In Subuth, many have been baptized by the Spanish” (<em
>In Subuth/ multi bapti/zati ab Hispani</em
>). Nearby, he says that on “Massana Island, Here governs a king of three
    islands. These islands are rich in gold and ginger” (<em
>Massana insula/ Hic trium insulam/ agit rex Hec [sic] auri et gingiberis/
    dives</em
>), alluding to the Amerasian spice ginger, which French Jesuits in the
    eighteenth century believed also to grow in Eastern Canada.
