<h1>Corte Realis Insula</h1>
<p>
    Vopel has named this large island off the coast of his Amerasian continent
    <em>Corte Realis insula</em>. The Portuguese explorer Gaspar Corte-Real,
    together with his father João Vaz Corte-Real and his brother Miguel, undertook
    a variety of exploratory voyages sponsored by the Portuguese Crown, including
    some of the first to reach what is today Newfoundland, as well as other parts
    of northeastern Canada.
</p>
<p>
    In the preface to his 1502 translation of Marco Polo, which he addressed
    directly to King John II, the Portuguese translator Valentim Fernandes
    proclaimed that the recent Corte-Real voyages had joined together Orient and
    Occident.
</p>
<blockquote>
    Even to the ultimate ends of the West and the beginnings of the East, all the
    way to the lands of the Great Khan (where already your powerful name [King
    John II] begins to resound), where lie the very noble provinces of Tenduch,
    Mangy, Tanguth, etc., the beginning of which, according to my limited
    knowledge, was discovered by the most honorable gentlemen Gaspar Corte-Real.<a

    Fernandes understood Columbus’, Corte-Real's, and Polo’s Indies to be one and
    the same, and in discussing them depicted an Amerasian Portuguese empire.
