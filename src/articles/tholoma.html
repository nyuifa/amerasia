<h1>Tholoma</h1>

<p>
    Marco Polo describes the province of Toloman as being east of Bengal; he says,
    “Here…the people are idolaters, speak a language of their own and are subject
    to the Great Khan…. They have a fair number of cities…. The country is rich in
    gold.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> Vopel confirms this by showing
    Tholoma just north and east of his Bangala, underscoring it with the phrase
    “The inhabitants have their own language, an abundance of gold, and many
    cities” (<em
>Incolae linguam habent/ propriam, aurique copiam/ et civitates multas</em
>.)

    Tholoma (Toloman, Tolm), traditionally part of Asia, came to border on or form
    part of the American lands during the course of the sixteenth century. The
    Behaim Globe (1492) and the Ruysch map (1507), for instance, both placed it
    near Cathay, and Jacob Stampfer’s “Globuspokal” (1552) or chalice globe,
    contemporaneous with Vopel’s map, showed Tholman on the coast of China. Vopel
    places it in the very center of his Amerasian continent. In the second half of
    the sixteenth century, following the work of Giacomo Gastaldi, Gerardus
    Mercator, and Abraham Ortelius, cartographers began to separate the Asian and
    American continents with a strait or a body of water. We might think that,
    forced to choose, cartographers would return Tholoma to Asia; instead, a great
    variety of maps, including Giacomo Gastaldi’s woodcut map
    <em>Cosmographia universalis</em> (c. 1561) and Giuseppe Rosaccio’s copper
    engraving <em>Universale descrittione</em> (1597) here below, both show
    Tholoma on the American continent, in what is today northwestern Canada. The
    American position of the toponym persisted well into the seventeenth
    century.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a>
