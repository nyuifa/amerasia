<h1>Saint Thomas, Evangelist of the Indies</h1>
<h2>Grace Walsh</h2>
<p>
    In the lands of western India, Caspar Vopel tells us that "Sophronius wrote
    that Christ has been made known to the neighboring [and the sacis] by the work
    of Thomas," (<i
>Sacis et vicinis Christum/ Thomae ministerio/ praedicatum esse Sophro/nius
    prodidit</i
>). The story of Saint Thomas found diverse cartographic expression in the
    sixteenth century, but perhaps nowhere more comprehensively than Giovanni
    Andrea Vavassore"s 1558 edition of Vopel"s world map, where the apostle can be
    found in three locations: in India, explicitly in his capacity as a preacher;
    on the southwest coast of Patagonia where a Thomasine cartographic tradition
    arose in the first half of the century; and most innovatively off the western
    coast of "Asia Magna"&#8211; a landmass that a contemporary viewer might
    identify as North America&#8211; where the illustration of a ship in full
    sail, the "<i>Velas de S. Thomae</i>" can be seen either debarking or
    embarking just above the figure of Ferdinand Magellan. As much as Thomas"s
    triple presence in this map complicates the geographic specificity suggested
    by legend, in many ways it is interwoven with a medieval European imaginary of
    India, the plasticity of which easily encompassed an expanding world
    geography. The rich interpretive potential of new discoveries in both the
    Americas and Asia would reveal the ancient footsteps of the saint, and in turn
    shape the geographic definition of the places where his legacy was perceived.
</p>
<p>
    In his account of the lives of the saints and apostles, the
    <i>Legenda Aurea</i> or "Golden Legend," thirteenth century writer Jacobus de
    Voragine opines on the meaning of Saint Thomas"s name, stating that it may
    come from <i>totus means</i>, meaning "total wanderer, one who is wholly
    outside himself in the love and contemplation of God."<a

        name="_ednref1"
        title=""
>[1]</a
>
    Though canonical scripture has little to say about Thomas"s occupation after
    the ascension of Christ into heaven, de Voragine"s
    <i>Legenda Aurea </i>attested to fantastic stories of Thomas"s travels in
    India, including widespread evangelization of the Indian people and
    surrounding miraculous events. These stories were taken up and adapted by
    early modern travel writers, ultimately informing explorers and missionaries
    who found themselves in new lands seeking validation for their discoveries,
    and justification for their imperial exploits. The Apostle Thomas became a
    mile marker, acting as a reference point by which explorers could orient
    themselves in unfamiliar territory, and he would eventually become a yardstick
    against which colonizing forces could measure the evangelical vocation of
    empire.
</p>
<p>
    The <i>Legenda Aurea</i> is not the earliest text to discuss Thomas"s travels
    in India. The account was compiled from numerous antecedents in both the
    antique and medieval tradition, namely the <i>Acts of Saint Thomas</i> and the
    apocryphal <i>Historia Certaminis Apostolici</i> (Apostolic History)
    attributed to a follower of Abdias of Babylon.<a
        href="#_edn2"
        name="_ednref2"
        title=""
>[2]</a
>
    Pseudo-Abdias"s <i>Acts</i> became the basis for both a historical and
    geographical tradition of Apostolic evangelization. Along with the
    contemporaneous <i>Passio Santi Bartholomaei</i>, it is thought to be an
    origin point for the Christianization of Ptolemy"s division of India, wherein
    the region is divided into a tripartite model by the respective evangelization
    routes of the apostles Matthew, Thomas, and Bartholomew.<a
        href="#_edn3"

    This tradition is visible in mappaemundi that predate the
    <i>Legenda Aurea</i>, such as in the Liber Floridus, a late ninth-early
    tenth-century encyclopedia with a sophisticated set of geographical,
    cosmological, and mathematical diagrams. Its author, canon Lambert of
    Saint-Omer, frames his diagrammatic approach to natural history
    Christologically, orienting his

    >stunning mappamundi</a
    >
    (Fig. 1) with the furthest reaches of the east at the top, symbolizing the
    origin point of both the beginning and end of the world: an extant paradise
    that is the site of both the creation of man and the second coming of Christ
    at the apocalypse.

<p>
    Just below this heavenly apogee and closer than any other terrestrial domain,
    the three Indias, "<i>prima</i>", "<i>media</i>", and "<i>ultima</i>", can be
    found.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a>
</p>
<p>
    The three Indias" proximity to paradise is perhaps predicated on this
    apostolic tradition, which was further embellished in the twelfth century by
    the mysterious Letter of Prester John, delivered, in most accounts, to the
    Byzantine emperor (link to Pivar essay on Prester John).<a
        href="#_edn5"
        name="_ednref5"
        title=""
>[5]</a
>
    While the letter explicitly reiterates the three-India model, it only
    distinguishes one of them&#8211; "ulteriore India"&#8211; by identifying it as
    the resting place of the body of the Apostle Thomas.<a
        href="#_edn6"
        name="_ednref6"
        title=""
>[6]</a
>
    The presence of the Christian priest-king Prester John in the distant lands of
    the east was closely aligned with the apostolic tradition, and the
    construction of a medieval concept of India frequently paired the two figures
    as saintly patriarchs and spiritual vanguards in a land otherwise populated
    with idolatry and monstrosity. For despite its proximity to the garden of
    Eden, India was also a land of monstrous marvels: Lambert of Saint-Omer
    illustrates this tension in his map, where we can see in the map"s labeling
    that India is the land of "<i>pigmei</i>" and "<i>fauni</i>" in addition to
    "<i>reges</i> <i>gentium</i>" (kings of nations).
</p>
<p>
    This dual Indian imaginary is carried forward in both the textual and the
    cartographical traditions of the later Middle Ages, forming the body of
    evidence upon which many of the first explorers of the New World would later
    base their observations. Furthermore, the particular story of Saint Thomas was
    well known, popularized as it was by de Voragine"s <i>Legenda Aurea</i>. This
    account tells of Thomas"s conscription as an architect by King Gundophorus of
    India. While the king is away on stately business, Thomas uses the funds
    allocated for construction of the palace to feed the poor, and successfully
    evangelizes much of the royal court which enrages the king upon his return. In
    retribution, he subjects Thomas to numerous tortures that are prevented by
    miraculous intervention. Finally, the king commands Thomas to sacrifice to a
    pagan idol, but the idol is destroyed at Thomas"s word in a demonstration of
    the superior power of the Christian God. He is then killed by the high priest
    out of vengeance.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a> This
    account was important and established enough to be included in the
    <a
            href="http://www.medievalart.org.uk/chartres/23_pages/Chartres_Bay23_key.htm"
    >windows of Chartres Cathedral</a
    >, where a full cycle of the apostle"s exploits in India leading up to his
    eventual martyrdom can be found in a twenty-eight vitrine cycle. Based on this
    foundational story, popular travel accounts such as Marco Polo"s
    <i>Travels</i> of the early fourteenth century and John Mandeville"s
    <i>Livre de Merveilles</i> some sixty years later both refer to the site and
    milieu of the saint"s resting place in India. Polo states:
</p>
<blockquote>
    The body of Messer Saint Thomas the Apostle is in the province of Malabar, in
    a little city; for there are few men there; nor do merchants come there, for
    there is no merchandise that can be exported and, what"s more, the place is
    very out of the way. It is quite true that many Christians and many Saracens
    come here for pilgrimage: for I tell you that the Saracens of this country
    have great faith in him; they say that he was Saracen and that he is a great
    prophet, and they call him avarian, which means "holy man""<a
        href="#_edn8"
        name="_ednref8"
        title=""
>[8]</a
>
</blockquote>
<p>Mandeville concurs:</p>
<blockquote>
    Fro this londe men goth many contreis and journees to a contr" that is called
    Mabaron. And that is a gret contry and a gret kyngdome, and ther beth many
    fair citees and tounes. In this londe lyth Seynt Thomas in flessh in a fair
    tumbe in the cit" of Calamye" In the cherche of Seynt Thomas is a greet ymage
    and that is a simulacre, and hit is wel y-dyght with precious stones and
    perles. And to that ymage men cometh fro ferre contrees with gret devocioun in
    pylgrimage.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
    These accounts built on the existing legend of Saint Thomas, providing
    additional information about the Indian context of his martyrdom and shrine,
    including miracles performed by the martyr"s relics, the idols of Indian
    people (Mandeville in particular describes an ox-headed idol (<a
        href="#_edn10"
        name="_ednref10"
        title=""
>[10]</a
>, Polo describes idols painted black<a
        href="#_edn11"
        name="_ednref11"
        title=""
>[11]</a
>), and other cultural practices such as reverence toward cows. In total, they
    imagine a contemporary India that is a crossroads of pagan faiths where the
    legacy of the saint endures as a testament to the presence and preeminence of
    Christian virtue amidst spiritual decline.
</p>
<p>
    It is on this basis that the navigational initiatives of explorers such as
    Christopher Columbus, Amerigo Vespucci, and Vasco de Gama, would have
    anticipated signs of Christianity in newly encountered lands. Though the
    medieval fervor of finding Prester John tapered off in the preceding
    century,<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a> the ongoing
    popularity of texts like Polo"s <i>Travels</i>&#8211;newly published in
    Portugal in 1502 with a dedication to "those who now go to the indies"<a
        href="#_edn13"
        name="_ednref13"
        title=""
>[13]</a
>&#8211;as well as the <i>Legenda Aurea</i>, assured that the legend of Thomas
    remained alive and well on the eve of the Age of Encounters. As such, a new
    round of accounts began to report the presence of Thomas in the New World.
    This seeming geographic confusion is elucidated by the early letters of
    Christopher Columbus, which frequently refer to the New World as the "Indies"
    and people within them as "Indians." Though the exact geography of the islands
    he landed on did not match the trusted descriptions in Marco Polo"s text,
    other elements of his encounters clearly corresponded with his expectations of
    an immense material abundance in Asia, including the presence of highly
    desirable spices and cotton.<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""
>[14]</a
>
    In addition to these worldly concerns, his copious observations about the
    spiritual disposition of the natives he encountered<a
        href="#_edn15"
        name="_ednref15"
        title=""
>[15]</a
>
    reflected the evangelical ambitions that would galvanize the Spanish imperial
    enterprise in the years to come. For many of the missionaries who would
    passionately undertake the immense task of native conversion, the legend of
    Saint Thomas would become an important underlying mythology and a lightning
    rod for the moral quandary of the condition of native humanity.
</p>
<p>
    Despite Saint Thomas appearing on maps as early as Martin Walseem"ller"s
    <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/2003626426/">Universalis Cosmographia</a> of
    1507, cholar Louis-Andr" Vigneras has pinpointed a 1514 travel account printed
    in Augsburg as the first eyewitness report of the apostle in the landmass
    recently named "America".

</p>
<p>
    In the <i>Copia der Newen Zeytung ausz Prasillg Landt</i> (Tidings out of
    Brazil), the author&#8211; a Portuguese or Italian trader&#8211; states:
</p>
<blockquote>
    " on this same coast they [the natives of Brazil] cherish the memory of Saint
    Thomas, they refer to him as the lesser god. There is, however, another god
    which is greater. It may be well believed that they do have memory of Saint
    Thomas, for it is known that the body of this saint is actually buried beyond
    Malacca on the Coast of Siramitl (Coromandel) in the Gulf of Ceylon. They
    frequently name their children Thomas in that land.<a

<p>
    This same account inspired a pamphlet by the cartographer Johann Sch"ner, who
    expanded the geographical understanding of the New World"s location by stating
    "Moreover there is only a short distance between Brazil and the Malacca
    region, where Saint Thomas received a martyr"s crown"<a

<p>
    As previously observed, this placement would live on the Vopel map of 1558.
</p>
<p>
    Strangely, apart from Vopel, the apostle"s name is largely absent from maps
    rendered of the Indian subcontinent at the time, despite the Portuguese having
    reached India by 1498 and their frequent interaction with Indian Christians
    throughout the first quarter of the sixteenth century. Notwithstanding their
    experience navigating in the region, and the circulation of maps like
    Waldseem"ller"s and Sch"ner"s theorizing the New World as a separate
    continent, there was no reason to categorically dissociate Indian Christians
    with the accounts of Thomas and the spiritual potential in the New World. Two
    years before both the completion of the Magellan mission across the Pacific
    and the Portuguese discovery of an overgrown Christian shrine and tomb at
    Mylapore on the Malabar coast of India, the manufacture of a richly
    illuminated atlas indicated that the Portuguese worldview still held the newly
    discovered lands in the Atlantic as part and parcel to a greater Asian
    landmass. The atlas, created for King Manuel 1 in 1519 and now referred to as
    the Miller Atlas, depicts many vibrant illustrations of the inhabitants of the
    diverse lands of the world and shows a remarkable geographic accuracy with
    regards to the continental contours of the southern and southeast Asian
    regions. However, the
    <a href="https://www.wdl.org/en/item/18562/">stunning frontispiece</a> (Fig.
    4) depicting a full, global map shows the Asian continent continuing eastward
    along the edge of the world and circumscribing the Indian Ocean, connecting to
    a great southern "Terra Incognita" before curving upward on the opposite side
    to reunite with a landmass clearly labeled "Mundus Novus, Brasil."

    Nevertheless, in 1521 excavations at Mylapore overseen by Captain Pero Lopes
    de Sampayo and documented firsthand by Gaspar Correia in his
    <i>Lendas da "ndia</i>, uncovered a domed chapel and tomb replete with cross
    motifs and preserved relics, compelling evidence that the search for the
    Ptolemaic India that lived on in the work of Polo and Mandeville had come to a
    victorious end.<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a>
</p>
<p>
    As the image of these new worlds continued to take shape, the discoveries at
    Mylapore did not have conclusive impact. They were challenged by missionaries
    in both Spanish and Portuguese camps on the basis of other premodern accounts
    stating that though Thomas preached and was martyred in India, his relics were
    transported to the city of Edessa in Asia Minor after his death. This was an
    especially popular argument of Spanish skeptics like Antonio de Torquemada who
    took the account of Isidore of Seville as the most authoritative.<a
        href="#_edn19"
        name="_ednref19"
        title=""
>[19]</a
>
    The existence of a venerable and privileged community of native Christians in
    the Indian subcontinent was enough to verify an apostolic presence but the
    questionable validity of the relics proved problematic to the Portuguese as
    well, particularly the Jesuits. Additionally, missionaries faced the question
    of religious lapse: when interpreting the customs of the self-identified
    Church of Saint Thomas, the influence of Syriac and Persian Christian
    traditions and the diverse interfaith milieu of southern India failed to
    conform to the vision of a Christian Eden prescribed by the legend. Despite
    the professed devotion of the Saint Thomas Christians, their practices were
    nonetheless seen as heretical with regards to Roman rite, perhaps reinforced
    by a unique regional iconography that bore similarity to Buddhist traditions
    in its depictions of angels and its use of animal motifs.<a
        href="#_edn20"
        name="_ednref20"
        title=""
>[20]</a
>
    This tension may be best encapsulated by the lengthy title of one of the first
    significant European histories describing the Saint Thomas Christian
    community, Ant"nio de Gouvea"s
    <i
    >Jornada do arcebispo de Goa Dom Frey Aleixo de Menezes primaz da India

    Malabar and the places where the Ancient Christians of Saint Thomas reside and
    brought them away from many errors and heresies in which they were mired, and
    reduced them to our Holy Catholic Faith, and obedience to the Holy Roman
    Church, from which they had been separated for more than a thousand years."<a

</p>
<p>
    In the New World, Spanish missionaries either seeking genuine evidence of the
    apostle or merely seeking inroads to capturing the native imagination in order
    to clear a path to conversion, recognized parallels between Thomas, Moses, and
    Christ and native Gods, particularly the figure of Topiltzin-Quetzalcoatl in
    Mexico. The Dominican friar Diego Dur"n, who was born in New Spain in the late
    1530s and worked as a missionary in both Mexico City and Oaxaca, learned
    Nahuatl and dedicated significant study to the Aztec religion as a means to
    better penetrate and overtake it. In doing so, he identified the remarkable
    similarities between Aztec and Christian rites that suggested biblical origins
    for the people of Mexico and a specific heritage of the apostolic tradition.
    Though he is wary of directly conflating Saint Thomas with
    Topiltzin-Quetzalcoatl, the mythological ruler of the Toltecs, he nonetheless
    catalogs their compelling similarities as an unmistakable continuum of
    Thomas"s apostolic mission, stating:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "I would not dare affirm that Topiltzin was one of the blessed Apostles.
    Nevertheless, the story of his life has impressed me greatly and has led me
    and others to believe that, since the natives were also God"s creatures,
    rational and capable of salvation, He cannot have left them without a preacher
    of the Gospel. And if this is true, that preacher was Topiltzin, who came to
    this land. According to the story, he was a sculptor who carved admirable
    images in stone. We read that the glorious apostle Saint Thomas was a master
    craftsman in the same art"<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[22]</a>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "Topiltzin was a man who had come from a foreign country. This indicates that
    he appeared in this land [as a newcomer], since I can find no account of his
    homeland. However, it is well known, that after he arrived in this country he
    began to gather disciples and to build churches and altars" Thus we can
    probably deduce that this man was an apostle whom God sent to this land and
    that the rest of them, the master craftsmen or wise men, were his disciples.<a
        href="#_edn23"
        name="_ednref23"
        title=""
>[23]</a
>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Dur"n was not the first. Letters from missionaries in Brazil attest to the
    apostle"s presence there: in 1538, fray Bernardo de Armencia identified Thomas
    in the Guaran" wise man figure of Pay"ume, also known as Pay Thome, and in
    1549 Jesuit Manuel de N"brega stated in his letters home "that without doubt,
    the apostle Thomas had preached in Brazil."<a
        href="#_edn24"
        name="_ednref24"
        title=""
>[24]</a
>
    Furthermore, the presence of cruciform imagery in the native iconographical
    traditions of the Maya and the Inca confirmed for missionaries the presence of
    an prior Christian presence in the Americas, and was reiterated in the
    influential writings of chroniclers Fern"ndez de Oviedo, Francisco L"pez de
    G"mara, and Peter Martyr.<a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title="">[25]</a>
    These monumental similarities with the findings at Mylapore contributed to an
    ongoing flexibility in the role India played in these missionaries" Amerasian
    understanding of global geography.
</p>
<p>
    Despite the vastly disparate cultures encountered in new territories by the
    Spanish and Portuguese respectively, they found a common problem related to
    their anticipation of a Christian presence: the religious realities they
    found, whether genuinely Christian or pagan in tradition, differed vastly from
    the precedent set up by the legend of Saint Thomas in antique and medieval
    literature. This evangelical dilemma correlated with and contributed to a
    wider European practice of conflating new geographic discoveries. The
    interchangeable imaginary of South America and the Indian subcontinent long
    after the 1521 excavations at Mylapore was as much due to the kind of
    geographic continuity demonstrated by the frontispiece of Miller Atlas and the
    Vopel Map as it was a compression of diverse characteristics into common
    cultural "other" defined by its polytheism, its exoticism, its complexion and
    nakedness, and its proximity to the tropical abundance that the nascent
    nations of Europe were seeking to access. This conflation expressed itself in
    an artistic culture that portrayed the "Indians" of the New World and the
    Indians of Asia with indistinguishable physical attributes, perhaps best
    illustrated in the widely circulated 1508 Hans Burgkmair print series
    <i>The Triumph of Maximilian I.</i> In a print titled

    Fig. 6: Hendrik Goltzius, <i>The Martyrdom of the Apostles </i>after Maarten
    de Vos" <i>The Martyrdom of Saint Thomas, </i>ca. 1590. 21.0 x 28.2 cm.
</p>
<p>
    The image curiously pictures Saint Thomas twice, standing upright with his
    iconographical attributes of a book and a spear adjacent to a scene of his
    martyrdom, where Indians outfitted in draped clothes with feathered epaulettes
    and feathered headdresses advance menacingly to inflict the final blow. In the
    background a similarly dressed figure who is seated astride a camel and
    sheltered by what appears to be a feathered parasol gazes imperiously over the
    scene. The landscape is further populated by palm trees to the right and
    treehouses occupying a distant canopy to the left. This scene appears to
    represent an amalgam of cultural signifiers, each with their own encoded
    geographical identity that today, in the twenty-first century, we view as
    distinct: the feathered headdresses of indigenous American peoples, the camel
    of North African and Middle Eastern nomads, the parasols of the far east, and
    the palm trees of a pan-tropical ecology.

<p>
    As the seventeenth century progressed, Thomas"s role as an explicit geographic
    reference point waned, though his symbolic importance as exemplar for
    missionaries in the Reformation remained. In a monumental altarpiece conceived
    for the High Altar of the Barefoot Augustinians in Prague in the late 1630s,
    Peter Paul Rubens

    at the ferocious hands of men clothed not in feather headdresses, as Goltzius
    would have, but in turbans and draping cloths, reflecting a more generally
    accurate Indian attire.

    In the shadow of a golden temple with elephant heads for column capitals and a
    pillar topped with a golden, horned idol, Thomas falls climactically at the
    feet of a stone cross like those discovered at Mylapore. The idol is
    reminiscent of an ivory figure of an Eastern god in the collections of Rubens"

    Mayu Fujikawa has suggested the influence of Johann Theodor de Bry"s popular
    1599 travel book <i>India Orientalis&#8211; </i>owned by Rubens&#8211; on his
    depiction of pagan idols, particularly the book"s illustration of
    <a href="https://archive.org/details/iiparsindiaeorie00lins_0/page/n187"
    >an idol in an Indian temple</a
    >.<a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title="">[28]</a> In the work of Rubens,
    Thomas"s former geographic uncertainty appears to be resolved.
</p>
<p>
    By Rubens" time, the apostle may have been evolving into a more general emblem
    of evangelical and imperial expansion. The Martyrdom of Saint Thomas was not a
    popular subject for European painting in the Renaissance, but Rubens had
    mingled the iconography of another altarpiece that perhaps indicates the
    changing significance of Saint Thomas as a spiritual and colonial model. Some
    twenty years earlier, his altarpiece depicting
    <a href="https://www.khm.at/objektdb/detail/1622/?offset=50&amp;lv=list"
    >The Miracles of Saint Francis Xavier</a
    >for the college adopted imagery reminiscent of Saint Thomas"s legend to
    underscore the holy mission of the Jesuits.<a

    As Xavier addresses a crowd of ill and dying from the steps of a pagan temple,
    a shaft of light emanates downward from the heavens, destroying a horned idol
    similar to the one depicted in the Saint Thomas altarpiece. The crowd itself
    bears a range of non-European cultural signifiers: the dark complexions of
    Sub-Saharan Africa, Turkish turbans, a queue hairstyle that could correspond
    either to Chinese or Indian sources, and even a man fully dressed in a Joseon
    dynasty Korean <i>banggeon</i> and <i>dapho</i>, although Xavier was never
    known to have gone to Korea or mainland China.<a

    Though there may have been genuine confusion between the costumes of different
    east Asian cultures of the time, the effect of the painting is not one of
    confusion, or conflation, but rather of symbolic convergence: the many and
    disparate idolators of the world gathered together to receive the word of
    Christ. The dialogue between the paintings points to a shift in the meaning of
    the Thomasine legacy. Where the apostle established the mission of the ancient
    church, Xavier and the Jesuits follow to manifest it in the modern age. Rather
    than representing a medieval vision of the east, of Eden and Prester John, an
    extant Christian land to be rediscovered and reclaimed, Thomas now projects
    into the future toward a global Christian empire precipitated by the holy
    office of the missionary.
</p>
<p>
    Though the presence of the Saint Thomas Christians at Mylapore provided
    overwhelming evidence of his missionary trajectory that is still held valid by
    biblical historians today, the inexact definition of India both as a cultural
    and territorial entity in the 16th century made these findings far from
    definitive. The same simultaneity with which Caspar Vopel depicted Thomas, he
    also applied to India itself, the Indias prima, media, and ulteriore of
    medieval mappaemundi having evolved and survived as Vopel"s Indias "maior
    Aethiopiae", "intra Gangem", and "extra Gangem", with the new appendage of
    "India orientalis" extending just north from the sails of Saint Thomas to the
    western edge of the map, apparently continuing onward to merge with the other
    side. (link to Riccio INDIA entry ) Finally, let us return to de Voragine"s
    etymology of Thomas: totus means, total wanderer. The <i>Legenda Aurea </i>and
    its ensuing tradition localize the saint"s ultimate destination in India, but
    not only did India"s perceived parameters merely grow to assimilate new lands
    into an existing global model, the missionary vocation by its very nature is
    one of continual displacement, its goal expansive, not restrictive. The legend
    provided an incredibly malleable framework through which to interpret the new
    into Eurocentric visions of a Christian world empire. As the unimaginably vast
    scope of global geography came slowly into view throughout the age of
    exploration, the potential for apostolic discovery only multiplied, and with
    it the geographic understanding of the Indies.
