<h1>Canibales</h1>

<p>
    Vopel placed the label CANIBALES on his South American continent; just to the
    south of this label, we see a man chopping up a human body, and to the
    southeast of this image, the word Antropophagi. The Greek historian Herodotus
    perhaps first described the Androphagi as a mythical race of cannibals living
    north of Scythia, and indeed, directly north of Scythia on the map is an
    inscription that speaks of “Antropophagi.” In his Geography, Ptolemy wrote of
    an “Island of Cannibals" somewhere in the Bay of Bengal, and these islands are

    As the historian Surekha Davies has discussed, in the Age of Encounters,

    While ethnographic and archaeological evidence does suggest the presence of
