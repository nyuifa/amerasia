<h1>Venetiae</h1>

<p>
    The city of Venice played a crucial role in the development of Amerasian
    visions of the world in two main ways. Firstly, it was the home of Marco Polo,
    the Venetian merchant who traveled to China between 1271-1295, and returned
    home to write about it in his <em>Book of the Marvels of the World</em>, also
    known as <em>The Travels of Marco Polo</em> (c.1300). Polo was hardly the
    first European to reach China; however, he was the first to record a detailed
    description of the Orient. His narrative account of China, India, Japan, and
    Southeast Asia inspired Columbus and generations travelers in his wake in the
    sixteenth century to look for and see Asia in the Americas.

    Secondly, Venice was one of the greatest centers for European print culture in
    the first half of the sixteenth century. More than 150 printshops and
    bookstores crowded Venice’s city center between San Marco and the Rialto at
    this time, and the Venetian print revolution unfolded concurrently with the
    European Age of Encounters; these phenomena directly influenced each other in
    what became a dynamic relationship between print and discovery.<a

    Venetian presses flooded the European market with books and maps about the New
    World, many of which, including the likes of Giovanni Battista Ramusio’s
    <em>Navigazioni e viaggi </em>(1550-59), as well as the maps of a great
    variety of Venetian cartographers, saw the world through Amerasian lenses.
