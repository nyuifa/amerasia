<h1>Paradise</h1>
<h2>Edward Chang</h2>
<p>Paradise is an analog to the earthly realm. It is a point toward which we look for something better, more ideal.
    Conversely, on Earth, our mortal existence is full of sacrifice and duress, compromise and corruption. From a
    biblical perspective, Paradise represents both human sin and salvation, bookending the human experience between
    man’s creation and fall and the final judgment and redemption.<a href="#_chang_edn1"
                                                                     name="_chang_ednref1"
                                                                     title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> This perspective of
    Paradise sets it apart from the human experience, and until the 5th century, it was not necessarily understood as a
    physical or achievable space. The argument of the Terrestrial Paradise<a
            href="#_chang_edn2"
            name="_chang_ednref2"
            title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a> complicates the relationship between humans and Paradise by creating the
    possibility of access to a space that was once understood to be unachievable. The Terrestrial Paradise becomes at
    once a space that is simultaneously real and imaginary, existing somewhere among man’s original sin, mortal
    suffering, and salvation. This paradox persists in maps and narrative accounts of the Middle Ages, and continues to
    vex and enchant exegetes and explorers into the 15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> centuries. The voyages of
    Christopher Columbus complicate our relationship with Paradise when, on his Third Voyage, Columbus claims to have
    found it. However, the link to the rhetoric of Paradise begins with his First Voyage and the discovery of lands to
    the West.</p>
<p>On Caspar Vopel’s 1545 map the Terrestrial Paradise does not make an appearance. It no longer figures into the
    cartography of the time. As 16<sup>th</sup> century explorers expand the understandings of the physical world, the
    possibility of a Terrestrial Paradise begins to fade. Vopel binds East and West in his heart-shaped Earth, and in
    doing so, sets the Americas adjacent to Europe, but attached to China. This configuration leaves no room for a
    Paradise that was once thought to be on the obverse of the world. However, the idea of Paradise still persists in
    the imaginary. There are still traces of the medieval marvels that inspired Columbus and his fellow explorers to
    seek the New World. Perhaps the evidence of Paradise lies in the presence of “cannibals, amazons, and
    anthropophagi<i>,” </i>as suggested by the likes of Mandeville and d’Ailly and scattered throughout the lands of
    Asia and America on Vopel’s map. </p>
<p>The discovery of Terrestrial Paradise by Christopher Columbus on his third voyage complicates understandings of the
    known world in the certitude with which he declares his discovery and his conviction in the evidence
    given.<a href="#_chang_edn3"
             name="_chang_ednref3"
             title=""><sup>[3]</sup></a> This can be a jarring revelation unless we first explore the history of man’s
    relationship with the idea of Paradise, and the accounts of Columbus’ first voyage. According to the histories
    provided by Las Casas,<a href="#_chang_edn4"
                             name="_chang_ednref4"
                             title=""><sup>[4]</sup></a> it is understood that, upon arrival on the eastern most point
    of Cuba, Columbus gives it the name: “Alpha et Omega.”<a href="#_chang_edn5"
                                                             name="_chang_ednref5"
                                                             title=""><sup>[5]</sup></a> While this particular
    appellation does not specifically refer to Paradise, the idea of the binary of beginning and end existing in one
    space hearkens back to medieval models of Paradise.</p>
<p>Along with other maps of the twelfth century, the Hereford Map conceived of a world that encompasses both physical
    and spiritual realms. While Columbus would not necessarily have used mappae mundi such as this to navigate, the
    prevalence of these pieces provided a framework with which to think about the understandings of the world through
    the thirteenth century and their influence on fifteenth century thinkers. Characteristic of mappae mundi, the
    Hereford Map is oriented to the East as opposed to the North,<a href="#_chang_edn6"
                                                                    name="_chang_ednref6"
                                                                    title=""><sup>[6]</sup></a> establishing a hierarchy
    of distance ranging from the lands of the European continent to the vast reaches of the East as represented by Asia.<a
            href="#_chang_edn7"
            name="_chang_ednref7"
            title=""><sup>[7]</sup></a> In such maps, the Terrestrial Paradise is represented at the very apex.</p>
<p>The effects of such a representation are manifold. A noteworthy effect this creates is that the Middle East or, for
    medieval audiences, the Holy Land, takes its place at the center of the map. In the Hereford Map, Jerusalem is
    clearly represented as an almost gear-like fortress. This emphasizes the center of the medieval world as the holy
    lands of Christianity and the combination of spiritual and physical worlds.</p>
<p>Following in a line eastward to the top of the Hereford map, we find the island Paradise, a representation of the
    Terrestrial Paradise as an island at the farthest reaches of the map. Clearly labeled, the island Paradise bears
    common imagery across most representations. Here, the Terrestrial Paradise is also marked with the four rivers of
    Paradise.<a href="#_chang_edn8"
                name="_chang_ednref8"
                title=""><sup>[8]</sup></a> The placement of Paradise at the easternmost extreme of the map reinforces
    its place, not at the periphery of the world, but at its beginning. In addition, the scene above the Hereford Map
    also places Paradise in proximity to the Last Judgment and the end of days. These representations make Paradise
    accessible by placing it on the map, and yet spiritual in its relation to the beginning and end of humanity.
    Columbus’ idea of “Alpha et Omega” seems here to have found a cartographic antecedent, but again, Columbus did not
    believe he had found Paradise on that first voyage. The significance here is that Paradise occupies space at the
    beginning and the end of the known world. </p>
<p>As Columbus does nine centuries later, Augustine of Hippo began a process of epistemology that would confuse the
    known and unkown. While Augustine’s arguments for a Terrestrial Paradise are rooted in exegesis and interpretations
    of Genesis,<a href="#_chang_edn9"
                  name="_chang_ednref9"
                  title=""><sup>[9]</sup></a> they establish a context through which the negotiation of the visible and
    invisible can begin. “History was not the result of some cosmic fall, but a process set in motion by God himself.
    The visible world was no mere reflection of a higher and eternal reality, but the work of an omnipotent creator and
    the stage on which God’s plan for the salvation of mankind was to be enacted.”<a href="#_chang_edn10"
                                                                                     name="_chang_ednref10"
                                                                                     title=""><sup>[10]</sup></a> Here,
    Scafi engages the relationship between the visible and the invisible world as a stage on which salvation is
    situated. The relationship between man and the Terrestrial Paradise is thus that of a play or a performance. The end
    result is salvation, but the actions and settings in between are but representations through which man may be saved.
    Shakespearean as it may be, the argument here is not merely a poetic musing,<a href="#_chang_edn11"
                                                                                   name="_chang_ednref11"
                                                                                   title=""><sup>[11]</sup></a> but an
    idea that is physically manifest. The idea of salvation factored greatly into Columbus’ third voyage, which is
    wrought with turmoil and comes to a rather inauspicious end.<a href="#_chang_edn12"
                                                                   name="_chang_ednref12"
                                                                   title=""><sup>[12]</sup></a> Augustine succeeds in
    creating a new set of signs that point to Eden and man’s relationship to Eden as both physical and spiritual.
    Augustine begins to change what was known about the world.</p>
<p>The maps themselves inhabit a space between devotion and practical function. Couched in the context of religion, the
    early mappae mundi represented the spiritual and physical understandings established by Augustine of Hippo. In fact,
    they were an acknowledgement of the existence of a physical world with known boundaries around which a greater
    spiritual landscape existed. The imago mundi, or image of the world created by such maps, incorporated the
    Terrestrial Paradise as a key component. The island nature of early representations reinforce contemporary accounts
    of the inaccessibility of Paradise. The wall and ring of fire surrounding the Island Paradise in the Hereford Map
    not only references Genesis,<a href="#_chang_edn13"
                                   name="_chang_ednref13"
                                   title=""><sup>[13]</sup></a> but also reinforces contemporary accounts and encounters
    with the Terrestrial Paradise.</p>
<p>It is through these accounts that Columbus builds points of reference for his Third Voyage.<a
        href="#_chang_edn14"
        name="_chang_ednref14"
        title=""><sup>[14]</sup></a> In addition to the work of Marco Polo, Columbus was known to have kept notes on
    medieval travel narratives. While Marco Polo’s account did not reference Paradise, other medieval accounts offered
    more insight into the subject of the Terrestrial Paradise. Many such narratives, like John Mandeville’s “Book of
    Marvels and Travels”<a href="#_chang_edn15"
                           name="_chang_ednref15"
                           title=""><sup>[15]</sup></a> were widely circulated beginning in the fourteenth century. Such
    narratives exposed their audiences to a diverse and marvelous world at the reaches of the known world. Despite his
    vast explorations, Mandeville also famously avoids engaging specifically with Paradise: “I can’t really describe
    Paradise properly because I haven’t been there, and that grieves me. However, I’ll describe what I’ve heard from
    wise men.”<a href="#_chang_edn16"
                 name="_chang_ednref16"
                 title=""><sup>[16]</sup></a> Mandeville goes on to note details in line with contemporary
    understanding, such as Paradise’s proximity to the lands of Prester John’s kingdom,<a
            href="#_chang_edn17"
            name="_chang_ednref17"
            title=""><sup>[17]</sup></a> as well as it being situated at a great elevation.<a href="#_chang_edn18"
                                                                                              name="_chang_ednref18"
                                                                                              title=""><sup>[18]</sup></a>
    Here the medieval audience learns of the names of the four rivers as well as the origins of their contemporary
    appellations,<a href="#_chang_edn19"
                    name="_chang_ednref19"
                    title=""><sup>[19]</sup></a> but again, the account is brief. Mandeville’s account reinforces the
    dynamic between what is known and what is unknown about Paradise. Honest though it may be, the inability to describe
    Paradise properly grieves Mandeville. The location of his discussion of Paradise is as notable as the brevity of the
    discussion, as it takes place only as a one-page aside from his description of Prester John near the very end of the
    text. Knowledge, or more accurately the lack of first-hand knowledge, manifests itself here in Mandeville’s account.
</p>
<p>The conception of Paradise is characterized by the struggle to express the inexpressible, but in his Third Voyage,
    Columbus no longer struggles. Bolstered by medieval accounts such as those of Mandeville and the Voyages of St.
    Brendan, Columbus takes a decidedly southern route through the Canaries, past Cabo Verde<a href="#_chang_edn20"
                                                                                               name="_chang_ednref20"
                                                                                               title=""><sup>[20]</sup></a>
    to points nearer to the tropics. In doing so Columbus sets off a chain of events established by earlier
    models.<a href="#_chang_edn21"
              name="_chang_ednref21"
              title=""><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p>By the third voyage Columbus had already encountered islands inhabited by women, and cannibals, all of which were
    consistent with medieval accounts of the lands nearest to Paradise.<a
            href="#_chang_edn22"
            name="_chang_ednref22"
            title=""><sup>[22]</sup></a> Beginning with the tropics themselves, Columbus’ aggressive approach has been
    interpreted in various ways, but under the assumption that if Columbus sailed with the intention of finding Paradise
    the first barrier would be to confront the flaming sword that stood guard at the gates after the Expulsion. As
    detailed by the zonal maps in Pierre d’Ailly’s Imago Mundi, the tropics were the edge of the “torrid
    zone.”<a href="#_chang_edn23"
             name="_chang_ednref23"
             title=""><sup>[23]</sup></a> Like “Alpha et Omega”, Columbus was aware of his approaching the edge of the
    known world. Through medieval exegesis and maps like the Hereford Map we see a pattern of evidence that points to
    the understanding of the tropics as the precipice upon which the known world is perched.</p>
<p>As Columbus notes 100 leagues off the coast of Cabo Verde, he experiences resistance due to the fact that he may be
    traveling upward, which is where he reinforces his idea of the pear-shaped earth<a href="#_chang_edn24"
                                                                                       name="_chang_ednref24"
                                                                                       title=""><sup>[24]</sup></a>.
    While seemingly outlandish, this convention comes from sources like Mandeville who, in his short section on
    Paradise, expresses that it is perhaps the highest point on Earth, so high it touches the moon.<a href="#_chang_edn25"
                                                                                                      name="_chang_ednref25"
                                                                                                      title=""><sup>[25]</sup></a>
    However false the idea may be, it is reinforced by writers like d’Ailly, whose zonal maps<a href="#_chang_edn26"
                                                                                                name="_chang_ednref26"
                                                                                                title=""><sup>[26]</sup></a>
    followed the Geography of Ptolemy and also included contemporary planar maps showing the various forces affecting
    the Earth. Columbus’ pear-shaped Earth is but an adaptation of that idea. As he moves ever towards Paradise,
    Columbus does the work of Augustine of Hippo. Columbus combines both sacred and secular accounts into the quest for
    Paradise.</p>
<p>Upon again reaching the islands west of the known world, Columbus begins to name and identify land masses based on
    medieval conventions, such as those of the Voyages of Saint Brendan.<a
            href="#_chang_edn27"
            name="_chang_ednref27"
            title=""><sup>[27]</sup></a> The various islands, waterways and land masses encountered on the third voyage
    bring the lands of Saint Brendan from fiction to reality. While not the first to materialize St Brendan’s voyages.<a
            href="#_chang_edn28"
            name="_chang_ednref28"
            title=""><sup>[28]</sup></a> Columbus’ active naming on this journey is consistent with the generative
    agency of Adam as he names all of the creatures and objects of the Earth. For Columbus, it marks the end of the
    Saint Brendan narrative and the beginning of the Columbus narrative. Once again, the quest for Paradise has
    traversed an end and a beginning. But it is rare for an explorer like Columbus to be so dedicated to the
    appropriation of one narrative. In the earlier voyages, the lands discovered were named for his patrons in the royal
    court of Spain in very appropriate acts of tribute.</p>

<p>In thinking about why Columbus would have adhered so closely to the particular narrative of Saint Brendan, we may
    consider the circumstances by which Columbus arrives and returns from this particular voyage. Valerie Flint examines
    in great detail the medieval sources for Columbus’ third voyage, as well as the inauspicious circumstances in which
    he returned to Spain,<a href="#_chang_edn29"
                            name="_chang_ednref29"
                            title=""><sup>[29]</sup></a> but what Flint does not necessarily examine is the shift in
    language between Columbus’ letters from the first and second voyages and his letter from the third voyage. It is the
    language here that relates back to the quest for Paradise. The letters of the first two voyages begin formally, with
    the first being addressed to “Sir”<a href="#_chang_edn30"
                                         name="_chang_ednref30"
                                         title=""><sup>[30]</sup></a> and the second beginning with, “Most noble
    sir.”<a href="#_chang_edn31"
            name="_chang_ednref31"
            title=""><sup>[31]</sup></a> The language here may be attributed to their being addressed to court officials
    or the writers being members of the crew, the matter of formality being particular to subjects of the royal
    highness. These first two letters are matter-of-fact reports of findings and interactions. That being said, the
    letter of the third voyage is penned by Columbus himself, and is not nearly as formal or reserved. It begins, not as
    a report, but more as a plea: “Most serene and most exalted and powerful Princes, the King and Queen, our
    Sovereigns: The Blessed Trinity of His Infinite goodness has chosen me to proclaim it to you; wherefore as His
    ambassador I approached your royal presence, moved by the consideration that I was appealing to the most exalted
    monarchs in Christendom, who exercised so great an influence over the Christian faith, and its advancement in the
    world.”<a
            href="#_chang_edn32"
            name="_chang_ednref32"
            title=""><sup>[32]</sup></a> It is in these contrasts that we find the essence of Paradise as a space that
    can not be realized, and yet still exists. The latter account calls not only on the royalty of the audience, but on
    their faith. It invokes the Blessed Trinity and proclaims Columbus as not just an Admiral, but an ambassador of God.
    Columbus truly believed that he had seen the Terrestrial Paradise.</p>

<p>Madness is often attributed to Columbus on this particular voyage, but it was faith that drove Columbus, not madness.<a href="#_chang_edn33"
                                                                                                                           name="_chang_ednref33"
                                                                                                                           title=""><sup>[33]</sup></a>
    At every turn in the Third Voyage Columbus took risks and was delivered from danger. As he skirted the coast of the
    Peninsula Paria and experienced the incomprehensible mixing of sweet water into the bay in inconceivable amounts,
    Columbus begins to piece together the idea of Paradise. His amazement, coupled with medieval antecedents, allows for
    Columbus to proclaim his discovery of the Terrestrial Paradise with confidence.<a href="#_chang_edn34"
                                                                                      name="_chang_ednref34"
                                                                                      title=""><sup>[34]</sup></a> Even
    when it is clear the Paradise he has discovered is not an island but a peninsula, Columbus’ faith is not shaken. His
    change of perspective is not without its medieval precedents,<a href="#_chang_edn35"
                                                                    name="_chang_ednref35"
                                                                    title=""><sup>[35]</sup></a> but the ease with which
    the perspective shifts is at the heart of man’s relationship to Paradise.</p>

<p>The key here is the mutability of Paradise. Existing both in the beginning and at the end and extending to the
    extreme edges of the known world, Paradise and the Terrestrial Paradise continue to be elusive. While this paradox
    seems to have been solved by Columbus in his third voyage, the medieval antecedents of Paradise show how fractured
    an understanding so illusory a space provides. In the case of Columbus’ voyages, he does seem to disrupt this
    fracture by collapsing medieval models. By the time Magellan circumnavigates the globe, there is no longer room for
    Paradise on the sphere of the Earth. The only spaces left for the concept of Paradise to inhabit were in the hearts
    and minds of the faithful.</p>

<p>With the exception of the Columbus Map, representations of Paradise become less frequent in the sixteenth and
    seventeenth centuries. No longer included in imago mundi, Paradise returns to a conceptual space. The argument of
    the Terrestrial Paradise does not end with Columbus however. Christianity needed Paradise to exist in a
    post-Columbian world.<a href="#_chang_edn36"
                            name="_chang_ednref36"
                            title=""><sup>[36]</sup></a> While Columbus proclaimed proudly that he had found Paradise,
    the subsequent expeditions to map and understand the New World landscape found no examples of the fabled land of
    Adam and Eve. John Milton, and exegetes of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries began to shift the paradigm of
    Paradise to speak of it as an extant, but lost space. While still a place to be found, theories of Paradise shifted
    from an existing space to a space relegated to the bottom of the sea by the Great Flood. Here we leave the Paradise
    conversation at the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>Whether at the bottom of the sea or the top of a mountain, the idea of Paradise still exists in its purest form, and
    is able to survive multiple interpretations and conceptions. It is able to inspire action and faith. The argument
    for a terrestrial Paradise is one that spans nearly a millennium and is able to produce artifacts like the Hereford
    map and subsequently impact the way man conceives of the physical world. The medieval narratives of John Mandeville
    and Pierre D’Ailly that involve Paradise form the way medieval man conceived of his world and relations with those
    in the world. Paradise occupies both figurative and literal, physical and the spiritual space. Elements of Paradise
    remain in the form of the Behaim Globe of 1492, which does not incorporate Paradise, but following medieval models
    like the Island of St Brendan. Seeking to combine both spiritual and physical worlds, Columbus was only successful
    in condensing the material representations. His third voyage does not necessarily disrupt, the paradox of Paradise;
    in fact, it reinforces its elusiveness by eliminating a possible location for the Terrestrial Paradise.</p>

<p>Having closed the door on the medieval conversation about Terrestrial Paradise, Columbus opened the door to new and
    varied interpretations. His own celebration of the discovery questioned the relationship between faith and nation.
    Columbus’ overture to the royal court of Spain appealed to their faith, but ultimately appealed for their support of
    his expeditions. In this moment, Paradise becomes a political tool. In invoking Paradise, Columbus simultaneously
    established the lands to the west as old and new spaces. The Columbus World Map<a href="#_chang_edn37"
                                                                                      name="_chang_ednref37"
                                                                                      title=""><sup>[37]</sup></a> shows
    just such a relationship. The map is curiously Eurocentric, as the main map does not even show the extent of Asia,
    let alone Columbus’ discoveries. It is the smaller, planar map that shows the most detail. Fashioned after Ptolemy’s
    nine spheres, the planar map includes the lands of the East and, most conspicuously, Paradise at the far East. Still
    there are no representations of the Columbus’ discoveries in the New World, but what the Columbus world map does is
    keep the idea of Paradise alongside the theories of Ptolemy. The sacred and the secular function together here in
    similar ways. By combining the geographical theories of Ptolemy and the medieval interpretations of Paradise,
    Columbus was able to achieve his greatest discoveries.</p>

    This affirmation is not swayed by the fact that the paradise he discovered was not on an island as he suspected. The

    to discussion of the great southern continent without hesitation and confirms his findings to be true.</p>
