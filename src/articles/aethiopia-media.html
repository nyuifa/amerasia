<h1>Aethiopia Media</h1>

<p>
    The full title for this region of northeastern Africa is Middle Ethiopia also
    Ethiopia Aetheria first called Atlantia (<em
>Aethiopia Media aethiopia Aetheria primus Atlantia dicta</em
>), a series of designations given in the ancient writer Pliny’s
    <em>Natural History</em> (6.187). The concept of Ethiopia and Ethiopians was
    multiple and expansive in the minds of Europeans from earliest Antiquity. In
    the opening lines of the <em>Odyssey</em>, Homer speaks of the Ethiopians who
    inhabited both the westernmost and the easternmost parts of the world.
    Ethiopia, sometimes metonymically standing in for all of Africa, had since
    antiquity often been confused or associated with India.<a

    On medieval <em>mappaemundi</em>, the Indian Ocean is often minimized and
    Ethiopia and India are pressed one against the other, treated as adjoining
    regions. In the late Middle Ages,the widely read travels of John of Mandeville
    recorded that the Nile flowed out of Earthly Paradise and through the deserts
    of India before running underground and coming up near Ethiopia, again
    connecting Africa to Asia.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a> On the
    Vopel map, a little south of Aethiopia Media, we see a region called “Greater
    India of Ethiopia” (<em>India maior Aethiopiae</em>), where the inhabitants
    are Christian and speak <em>linguam Chaldaicam</em>, or Aramaic, and in this
    region Vopel places the legendary ancient Christian king Prester John, who was
    alternately located in both Ethiopia and India (see Larimore Pivar essay on
    Prester John). When in August of 1441 missions of the Patriarch of Alexandria
    in Egypt came to Florence from the Ethiopian Convent of Jerusalem, these
    people were considered “Indians from Greater India sent by Prester John.”<a

    It seems clear that Vopel is adopting some such understanding of an Indian
    Ethiopia.
</p>
<p>
    Although often associated with northeastern Africa, the toponym Ethiopia and
    the designation Ethiopian, deriving from the words “burnt face” or of dark
    complexion, often stood for all Africa and Africans. Accordingly, on the Vopel
    map we see the toponym throughout Africa, such as
    <em>Aethiopia Inferior</em> (lower Africa) to the West and
    <em>Aethiopia interior seu maior</em> (interior or greater Africa) in the
    center of the continent near the equator. Towards the south is Agisymba, a
    region deep in Africa mentioned by Ptolemy and said by him to contain large
    animals, such as elephants and rhinoceros (we see an elephant not far away);
    here it is labeled <em>Agisymba regio magna Aethiopum</em>, or greater
    Agisymba region of the Ethiopians.

    Given the wide applicability and Indian associations of the idea of Ethiopia,
    it is not surprising to find in the post-Columbus period that Africa enters
    into the Amerasian formation in numerous ways. In his
    <em>De insulis meridiani atque indici maris nuper inventis</em> (On the
    Islands of the southern or Indian sea, recently discovered, ca. 1494), Nicolò
    Scillacio—a Sicilian humanist interested in geography and cosmography—believed
    that Columbus had sailed to Ethiopia, Arabia, and across the Indian Ocean, a
    claim that helps explain why the earliest images related to Columbus’s
    discoveries, an illustration to Columbus’s letter to Santángel (<em
>De insulis nuper in mari indico repertis</em
>. Basel, 1494), show the newly discovered peoples engaged in commercial
    relations with turban-wearing inhabitants of better-known parts of the Asian
    world.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a>

<p>
    When the humanist Francisco de Támara composed
    <em
    >El libro de las costumbres de todas las gentes del mundo, y de las
        indias</em
    >
    (Antwerp, 1556)— his Castilian translation of Johannes Boemus’
    <em>Omnium gentium mores, leges et ritus</em> (Augsburg, 1520), which had only
    considered Africa, Asia, and Europe—Támara grouped the Americas with Africa.
    We see the same association in two drawings by the German artist Hans
    Burgkmair of around 1520, which show African men modeling American vestments
    and weapons.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a> On his 1520 trip to the
    Low Countries, Albrecht Dürer was presented with many exotic items, including
    “several feathers, Calecutish things”, “2 Calecutish ivory salt cellars”,
    “Calecutish cloths, one of them of silk.” The ivory salt cellar was certainly
    African, probably from the region of Benin for Portuguese export, the silk
    cloths were probably Asian, and the feathers were no doubt American. Yet Dürer
    describes them all as “Calecutisch,” or Indian.<a
