<h1>Calicut</h1>

<p>
    The city of Calicut, known today as Kozhikode in the southern Indian state of
    Kerala, had a long history in the trade and commerce of Oriental spices that
    dated back to classical antiquity in Europe.
</p>
<p>
    Calicut persistently weaves its way through the history of Amerasia as a
    symbol of eastern wealth and a stand in for the concept of India itself (link
    to INDIA EXTRA GANGEM entry). Rodrigo de Santaella’s 1503 translation of
    Polo’s Travels, for instance, places port scenes of Cuba and Malabar, the
    ports of Santo Domingo and Calicut, next to one another in its frontispiece,
    asserting the association of these two places (link to Cuba entry). Hernán
    Cortés believed Southeast Asia and the lands recently discovered across the
    Atlantic to be so close and so related that he brought with him to Mexico two
    translators: a slave from Calicut, and a morisco, fluent in Arabic, indicating
    quite directly his understanding of the Americas as Oriental lands.<a

    The American turkey became known in Europe as an Asian bird or a rooster of
    India: the
    <em>gallo d’India, pavo de las Indias, coq dinde, the indianish han</em>, and
    more specifically, the <em>gallo di Calicut</em>.<a

    In 1603, the English globe maker Emery Molyneux produced one of the first
    terrestrial globes in England; it now resides in the Middle Temple Library in
    London. His globe depicts the Americas and Asia as separate and distinct. And
    yet, the part of his globe that is today called Mexico shows the toponym
    <em>Calicutan</em>. Many of the other toponyms on this part of his globe are
    identifiable: <em>Marata, Coana, Petatlan</em> and <em>Culiacan</em>, for
    instance, all represented Indian “kingdoms” visited by Coronado, or
    <em>Astatland</em>, surely referring to the land of Aztlán, the mythical,
    ancestral homeland of the Aztecs. <em>Calicutan</em>, by contrast—a provincial
    toponym, placed prominently at an angle, to cover a broad swathe of
    territory--does not appear to correspond to any known Mexican place. It is not
    just one city among many, or perhaps a small error, but instead, a carefully
    considered regional label. It is difficult not to read this as a kind of
    Mexican <em>Calicut</em> (or <em>Calecut</em>, as it is indicated on the
    Indian subcontinent, on the other side of Molyneux’s globe); representing an
    Amerasian persistence, or an ongoing fusion of Mexico, New Spain, and India,
    that continued subtly but steadily to inform English visions of commerce and
    wealth to be gleaned in the Orient at the end of the sixteenth century.
