<h1>Messigo</h1>

<p>
  Vopel tells us that “in the times of our ancestors, Messigo was known by the
  term ‘Mansi’” (<em>Temporibus auo/rum mansi vo/cabulo innotuit</em>). He
  derived this idea from the Belgian cartographer Franciscus Monachus, whose
  <em>De orbis situ ac descriptione</em> (Antwerp, 1527), claimed that Mangi, or
  southern China, and Mexico were the same place, and that Mexico was Mangi’s
  modern name (link to <a href="#mangi">Mangi entry</a>). Indeed, on Vopel’s
  map, Mexico is in the Kingdom of Cathay, and in the province of Mangi.
</p>
<p>
  As Vopel’s tell us in his cartouche concerning Temixitan or Tenochtitlan (link
  to <a href="#cartouche-temixitan">cartouche on Temixitan</a>), Mexico was the
  furthest extent of Polo’s Asia; Polo had gone to Mexico, and Hernán Cortés had
  effectively reached China when he conquered Tenochtitlan. The Aztec
  ceremonies, customs, and wealth that Cortés described in his letters suggested
  an implicit similarity for European audiences between Cortés at the court of
  Montezuma and Polo at the court of the Great Khan. For early modern observers,
  the sparkling cities of Mexico surely resembled the Asian cities visited by
  Polo, implying that the opposite could also be true, an idea that Vopel’s
  cartouches and toponyms support.

  The narratives of a variety of explorers and conquistadors who traveled north
  from Mexico during the course of the sixteenth century further corroborated
  these ideas, revealing that up to 1600 and beyond, many believed that lands to
  the North of Mexico might be directly connected to China, India, or both. For
  example, when the Franciscan explorer Franciscan Marcos de Niza returned to
  Mexico City after his journey into the American southwest in 1539, a great
  variety of people who heard his account reported his sighting of elephants,
  camels, and people wearing silk in what is today New Mexico. In a later
  expedition in 1604, the conquistador Juan de Oñate searched for the Golden
  Fleece near the Gulf of California.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a>
  These and a variety of other accounts all contributed to “the popular
  conviction of the day that North America was an extension of the Orient.”<a

  The relationship between Mexico and China was, for many, at the heart of an
  Amerasian understanding of the world. In his
  <em>Opusculum Geographicum</em> (1533), the German cosmographer and
  cartographer Johann Schöner, for instance, similarly described Polo traveling
  in Mexico.
</p>

<blockquote>
  There is a land called Mexico and Temistitan in Upper India, which in former
  times was called Quinsay…Before our time, this continental portion of upper
  Asia [Mexico] beyond [the area described by] Ptolemy was explored by Marco
  Polo of Venice... The land which is called Mexico or Temistitan, in India
  Superior, which before was called Quinsay, that is, “city of heaven” in their
  language.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The twelfth edition of the Dominican missionary and chronicler Fra Gregorio
  García’s
  <em>Origen de los indios del Nuevo Mundo e Indias Occidentales</em> (Madrid,
  1729), continued to argue that Polo and other medieval travelers in China had
  reached to Mexico before Cortés, revealing a continuous chain of thought about
  the connectedness of Mexico and China that persisted more than two hundred
  years after the Columbian voyages.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a> In
  a material expression of this relationship, the Mixtec <i>Cospi Codex</i>, now
  in Bologna, which was considered a book from China as late as 1667 (link to
  <a href="#agnew-hieroglyphics">Hieroglyphics essay</a>).
</p>
<p>
  In a parallel Amerasian association, a great variety of early modern European
  historians, antiquarians, and orientalist scholars believed the Mexicans to
  have been descended from the ancient Hebrews. The Domican friar Diego Durán,
  for instance, argued in the first chapter of his ethnohistory of the Aztecs,
  <em>The History of the Indies of New Spain</em> (1581, though unpublished
  until the nineteenth century), that Aztec ceremonies, rites, superstitions,
  and idolatrous practices were like those of the Hebrews.<a
    href="#_edn5"
    name="_ednref5"
    >[5]</a
  >
  Based on all their cultural similarities, Durán determined that indigenous
  Americans were descended from the Ten Tribes of Israel and that Mexicans were
  of Jewish origin, generating an Amerasian vision of Mexico as originally
  populated by Oriental peoples. Based on a variety of cultural and linguistic
  similarities, many European observers debated if and how the populations of
  Mexico could have had descended from Adam via the sons of Noah, well into the
  nineteenth century.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a>
</p>
<p>
  By 1600, as a result of the Manila galleon trade, Mexico would be flooded with
  a great variety of Asian goods that was to imbue Mexican life and artisanry
  with Asian techniques and forms. Though the Vopel map was designed several
  centuries before the start of this trading network, Vopel does indicate the
  islands of the Philippines on the far left side of his map (link to
  <a href="#subuth">Subuth entry</a>), indicating the site from which
  trans-Pacific trade and commerce would effectively orientalize Mexico by the
  turn of the seventeenth century.
