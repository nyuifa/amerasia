<h1>Antiquity Beyond the Horizon: Thomas More’s <i>Utopia</i> and the New World </h1>

    freedom, obeying no one.</p>
<p>(Vopel map printed by Vavassore, 1558, near Brazil)</p>
<p> Thomas More’s <i>Utopia </i>occupies an enigmatic space in the history of literature and political thought. The
    story, written as an audience between More and fellow real-life humanist Peter Giles and fictional character Raphael
    Hythlodaeus, blends fact and fiction, satire and sermon, to create an account that coyly straddles the boundaries
    between plausible testimony, absurd fantasy, and moral manifesto. Organized into a two-book structure, Hythlodaeus
    first expounds on a critique of the inequity of European–predominantly English–society, and then offers a
    description of the island commonwealth of Utopia as a moralizing counterexample. According to his account, after
    staying behind with a contingent from Amerigo Vespucci’s fourth voyage in the New World and traveling westward
    through diversely peopled lands, Hythlodaeus came upon Utopia, an island society with a sophisticated political,
    economic, and social system based around communitarian principles: property in common, a disdain for gold and
    precious stones, religious tolerance, pacifism; equal distribution of labor, and a strict penal system. First
    published in 1516, <i>Utopia’</i>s New World setting has been the subject of scrutiny as centuries of Morean
    scholars have attempted to untangle its course among the many philosophical threads woven into this improbable tale.
</p>
<p>While the references, both direct and indirect, to the details of Vespucci’s letters are clear in the text, there has
    nonetheless been much debate about the extent to which accounts of transatlantic exploration shaped the overall
    content and motifs of <i>Utopia. </i>One argument is that More’s vision of a peaceful, orderly commonwealth is far
    too estranged from Vespucci’s description of naked, uncouth, and sometimes violent New World natives, and so this
    inspiration must have been incidental at best.<a href="#_edn1"

    a clear emphasis on Greek culture and philosophy points to ancient authors such as Plato, Homer, and Lucian as
    More’s primary influences, rather than any contemporary writing.<a href="#_edn2"
                                                                       name="_ednref2"

    certainly strove to promote ancient philosophy as a guiding principle for scholarly thought and rhetoric, and his
    circle particularly privileged Greek writing and philosophy over Roman.<a href="#_edn3"
                                                                              name="_ednref3"

    Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam was at the forefront of this push, publishing the first modern Greek translation of
    the New Testament in the same year as More’s <i>Utopia,</i><a href="#_edn4"
                                                                  name="_ednref4"
                                                                  title=""><sup>[4]</sup></a>and More himself was a
    noted Greek and Latin scholar, better known for his translation of Lucian than the text of
    <i>Utopia.</i><a href="#_edn5"
                     name="_ednref5"
                     title=""><sup>[5]</sup></a> However, these superficial incompatibilities with explorers’ accounts
    do not preclude the importance of the New World as both a physical and conceptual setting for the Utopians; rather,
    More’s text often dramatizes the ways in which accounts from the New World were fitted into existing paradigms of
    geography and world history built on antique models. <i>Utopia </i>repeatedly reveals and develops these paradigms
    while exploiting the shifting terrain of new geographical discoveries. </p>
<p>Initially published in Leuven in Latin, several editions of <i>Utopia</i> were printed in More’s lifetime accompanied
    by a group of appendices that reinforced the false authenticity of Hythlodaeus’s story. The text is introduced as a
    true account related in person to More in the company of Peter Giles. Their mutual friend Erasmus helped gather
    letters from accomplished scholars from their circle to preface the book along with a <a
            href="https://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/.a/6a00d8341c464853ef01b7c863db20970b-popup"
            target="_blank">map of the island </a>(the original designer of which is unknown) and a poem by the supposed
    poet laureate of Utopia with a Utopian-to-Latin translation. In the second edition of 1518, this map was <a

            target="_blank">illustration of Hythlodaeus</a> in audience with More and Giles. The various letters that
    accompanied the text– from Giles to Hieronymus van Busleyden, from More to Giles; from Erasmus to printer Johann
    Froben, and later from Parisian scholar Gillaume Budé to Thomas Lupset in the 1518 edition– all refer to the content
    of the book as though it were fact, adding to the illusion of truth. The most compelling component of the ruse,
    however, is the text’s relationship to the widely published letters of Amerigo Vespucci. </p>
<p><i>Utopia</i> was written approximately eleven years after Vespucci’s letter to Piero Soderini describing his four
    journeys was first published in Florence circa 1505-1506 under the title <i>Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci delle isole
        nuovamente trovate in quatro suoi viaggi</i><i>. </i>The following year, Martin Waldseemüller published his
    historic <a
            href="https://www.loc.gov/item/2003626426/"
            target="_blank">Universalis Cosmographia</a> map depicting an insular western Atlantic landmass titled
    “America” for the first time, in honor of Vespucci. A Latin translation of the <i>Lettera</i> was included in the
    map’s accompanying treatise, the <i>Cosmographiae Introductio, </i>and several historians have made compelling
    arguments that it is this version of Vespucci’s letter that More accessed.<a href="#_edn6"
                                                                                 name="_ednref6"
                                                                                 title=""><sup>[6]</sup></a> The
    letter’s denouement of the fourth voyage serves as the point of departure for Hythlodaeus’s account, creating a
    deliberate air of factual continuity. As Vespucci reaches the conclusion of his letter to Piero Soderini, he states,
</p>
<p style="margin: 8%">“Having done all this, we decided to return to Portugal, which was on a course northeast by north;
    we left behind twenty-four men to remain in the fort, supplies for six months, twelve mortars and many other
    weapons; and we pacified all the people of that land, of whom no mention has been made for this voyage, but not
    because we did not see and have dealings with countless people there: for thirty of our men went forty leagues
    inland, where I myself saw so many things I must delay relating, saving them for my <i>Four Journeys.</i>”<a
            href="#_edn7"
            name="_ednref7"
            title=""><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>
<p>This intriguingly open-ended description provided an aperture for More to insert his character’s account into a
    record that was still under scrutiny.<a href="#_edn8"
                                            name="_ednref8"
                                            title=""><sup>[8]</sup></a> In the opening pages of <i>Utopia</i>, Giles
    introduces Hythlodaeus to More, making direct reference to both Vespucci’s exact words:</p>
<p style="margin: 8%">“He went everywhere with [Amerigo Vespucci] throughout the last three of his four voyages- the
    ones that everyone is now reading about. Except, on the last voyage, he did not come home with him. He begged and
    even threatened Amerigo until he agreed to let hims stay behind as one of the twenty-four who were to be left
    garrisoning a fort at the furthest point to which their journey had taken them.”<a href="#_edn9"
                                                                                       name="_ednref9"
                                                                                       title=""><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>
<p>            Other continuities with Vespucci’s letters became interpretive, incorporating the peoples and environs of
    newly discovered territories into antique paradigms. In some attempts to reconcile discrepancy between More’s highly
    civilized (by European standards) Utopians and Vespucci’s descriptions of New World natives that range from the
    naive to the monstrous, there is debate that the premise of the Utopian commonwealth is based on Vespucci’s choice
    of classicizing terms for what he viewed as an essentially primitive society. In particular, amidst stories of
    cannibalism, lascivious sexual practices, murder, and naïveté (some of which was illustrated in no uncertain terms
    in <a
            href="https://static.cambridge.org/resource/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20170127070941765-0481:9781139568128:03667fig3_3.png"

            target="_blank">Johannes Grüninger</a> that accompanied the 1509 German edition of the <i>Lettera</i>) he
    repeatedly describes the new territories as a paradise and the people within them as “Epicurean.” A particular
    passage of interest occurs in a fragmentary letter by Vespucci referred to as the “Ridolfi Fragment”:</p>
<p style="margin:8%">“…those inhabitants prize neither gold nor other riches which we value and hold in great esteem,
    arguing that contrary to this we said we bought slaves from them…. for, as I said their life is rather more
    Epicurean than Stoic or Academic, because, as I state, they hold no private property, nor have they divisions into
    kingdoms or provinces: in conclusion, all that they have they hold in common…”<a href="#_edn10"
                                                                                     name="_ednref10"
                                                                                     title=""><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>
<p>Later in his letter to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de’Medici he states again that “They live according to nature, and
    might be called Epicureans rather than Stoics.”<a
            href="#_edn11"
            name="_ednref11"
            title=""><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>
<p>While this term is far gentler than some of the more barbaric characterizations of indigenous people, it neatly
    encapsulates a number of Vespucci’s observations: that these people were pleasure-seeking, non-Christian, and living
    in a state of prelapsarian naïveté for which an idyllic antiquity provided a convenient model.<b> </b>Thomas More
    liberally expands this construct beginning with Utopians’ philosophy of pleasure, their primary ethic of happiness,
    stating,</p>
<p style="margin: 8%">“They discuss virtue and pleasure, but their main topic of debate, their primary concern, is the
    understanding of human happiness… they hold that its happiness cannot be identified with pleasure, then at least
    pleasure is the main factor that makes for happiness…”<a href="#_edn12"
                                                             name="_ednref12"
                                                             title=""><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>
<p>He further applies an Epicurean model in his description of their legal and penal systems. The harsh consequences for
    lawbreakers–slavery, exile or death– rely on a universal and idealistic ethic of civic obligation where social
    accountability and self-interest are intertwined.</p>
<p>Vespucci’s letters may have left an opening for a Classical or Hellenistic imaginary of a New World society, but his
    explicit references to antiquity are limited. Nevertheless, More adopts and develops this model in a way that
    transcends analogy, devising a literal Mediterranean origin for the people of Utopia:</p>
<p style="margin: 8%">“According to their history books, they had no information whatever regarding our part of the
    world (they call us the Ultra-equatorials) before I made landfall there, with one exception. Twelve hundred years
    ago a ship, which had been blown off course by a storm, was wrecked on the island of Utopia. Some Romans and
    Egyptians were tossed onto the shore and remained on the island for the rest of their lives.”<a href="#_edn13"
                                                                                                    name="_ednref13"
                                                                                                    title=""><sup>[13]</sup></a>
</p>
<p>A significant tool that More uses to forge this heritage is language and wordplay, noting the the Utopians’ ease in
    developing proficiency in Greek in one passage<a href="#_edn14"
                                                     name="_ednref14"
                                                     title=""><sup>[14]</sup></a> and later explaining that the Utopians
    must be descended from the Greeks because their language is etymologically similar.<a href="#_edn15"
                                                                                          name="_ednref15"
                                                                                          title=""><sup>[15]</sup></a>
    This justifies the many Greek pun names for locations, demonyms, and characters that populate Utopia. Most
    significant among them is the name for Utopia itself, which elicits two simultaneous translations: Eu-topia
    (ευτοπος), meaning “good place”, and Ou-topia (ουτοπος), meaning “no place”. Raphael Hythlodaeus’ name is a humorous
    compound of hythlo and daeus (δαιων, υθλος), meaning peddler or distributor of nonsense. These tongue-in-cheek
    epithets are found throughout, from the Utopian capital, <i>Amaurot</i> (αμαυρος, “Unknown” or “Dark” City), to a
    fictional society Hythlodaeus encountered in his travels through Persia called the Polylerites (πολυ, ληρος, “people
    of much nonsense.”)<a href="#_edn16"
                          name="_ednref16"
                          title=""><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>
<p>These names are couched in a dry humor that hints at the murky authenticity of the account, but they also reflect the
    geographical ambiguity of the New World in European consciousness. The veracity of accounts from New World journeys
    did not go undisputed (even Vespucci’s letters), and the understanding of the New World’s spatial relationship to
    both Europe and known Asian territories evolved and was adapted throughout the 16th and 17th centuries in response
    to changing information. Historian Toby Lester has suggested that More’s use of wordplay, particularly the double
    meaning of “Utopia”, may have been directly inspired by Waldseemüller’s <i>Cosmographiae Introductio, </i>where
    writer Matthias Ringmann’s historic choice to christen the New World “America” may have employed the same logic of
    the “no-place” as clever subtext to its overt association with Amerigo Vespucci.<a

            name="_ednref17"
            title=""><sup>[17]</sup></a> For Vespucci, the eastern edge of what is now called South America represented
    the confluence of paradise, heathendom, and the far more mundane trading pathway to Malacca.<a href="#_edn18"
                                                                                                   name="_ednref18"

    For More, these overlapping identities validated a mythological reality in new lands. </p>
<p>As part of his sleight-of-hand with the truth, Thomas More leaves the location of the island of Utopia to the
    imagination of the reader, stating in his preface letter to Peter Giles that he “forgot to ask… just where in the
    New World Utopia is to be found.”<a href="#_edn19"
                                        name="_ednref19"
                                        title=""><sup>[19]</sup></a> Keeping its location secret allowed it to reside in
    a liminal state where the mythical and the real coexist. Although the exact location remains undetermined, he
    localizes Utopia using a <a
            href="http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/blogs/world-map-after-macrobius"
            target="_blank">zonal model</a> of the earth. Unlike Vespucci, who refers to passing through the “torrid”
    equatorial zone only to refute its supposed hostility<a
            href="#_edn20"
            name="_ednref20"
            title=""><sup>[20]</sup></a>, More refers implicitly to the zonal model and reinforces it through
    descriptions of the harsh equatorial landscape:</p>
<p style="margin: 8%">“To be sure, south of the equator, and indeed on either side of it for almost as far as the sun is
    distant from the earth, there lie vast empty deserts, scorched by the perpetual heat. In every direction the view is
    gloomy and dismal. Nature is wild and uncultivated. There are savage beasts and dangerous serpents, and a few men
    who are no less savage and dangerous than the creatures they live among. But if you keep traveling, slowly nature
    becomes more friendly. The climate is less harsh, the sun less scorching, the creatures les predatory. At length you
    reach civilization again.”<a
            href="#_edn21"
            name="_ednref21"
            title=""><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>
<p>Describing Hythlodaeus’s journey through the torrid zone and beyond, More fills in the gaps between zonal geography
    and the Greek and New World imaginaries by describing the monsters found in the torrid zone in mythological terms:
    “Scyllas, or rapacious Celaenos, or man-eating Laestrygonians, or other monsters just as remarkable.”<a
            href="#_edn22"
            name="_ednref22"
            title=""><sup>[22]</sup></a> Expressed in recognizable terms, the man-eating giants and sea serpents of
    Odysseus and the Amazons of Heracles neatly enjoin with reports of Patagonian giants, Amazons, and cannibals that
    populate literature and cartography charting the exploration of the New World well into the 16th century, including
    the Caspar Vopel map printed by Vavassore in 1558. </p>
<p>The Utopians themselves also endorse, albeit obliquely, a zonal construct of the world. Despite having “no
    information whatever regarding [Europe],” Hythlodaeus reports, “they call us the
    Ultra-equatorials.”<a href="#_edn23"
                          name="_ednref23"
                          title=""><sup>[23]</sup></a> More does not expand on Utopian notions of “Ultra-equatorial”
    geography, but paints an overall picture of a people with scientific and philosophical competence on par with the
    antique Mediterranean, particularly in “music, logic, arithmetic, and geometry,” but astronomy above all else.<a
            href="#_edn24"
            name="_ednref24"
            title=""><sup>[24]</sup></a> The zonal model being based originally on Pythagorean constructs and having
    evolved through a series of ancient adaptations concluding in Macrobius,<a
            href="#_edn25"
            name="_ednref25"
            title=""><sup>[25]</sup></a> it is reasonable for the reader to believe that the Utopians have come to
    parallel conclusions about the antipodes as the Europeans, and the reference to “Ultra-equatorials” posits the
    equator as the boundary for that reflection. Beyond that frontier, the residents of one side become both mirror and
    myth to the other, occupying antipodal temperate zones divided by the wasteland.</p>
<p>Guillaume Budé’s letter to Thomas Lupset prefacing the 1518 edition of <i>Utopia</i> suggests a far more specific
    identity that explicitly superimposes the mythical on the real:</p>
<p style="margin: 8%">“[Utopia is] surely one of the Fortunate Isles, which may lie close to the Elysian Fields-
    Hythloday, as More himself says, has not yet told us exactly where it is located… a community comfortable with its
    own customs and possessions, blessed with innocence and leading what we might call a heavenly life- Utopia is not in
    heaven, it is true, but it is certainly far superior to the muck that pervades the known world…Utopia, an island in
    the New World…”<a
            href="#_edn26"
            name="_ednref26"
            title=""><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>
<p>This may be adapted from Vespucci, who no less than three times in his letters refers to the “Fortunate isles” as a
    key portal through which he passed toward the New World, though in his case he clarifies that it is another name for
    the very tangible Canary Islands.<a
            href="#_edn27"

    virtuous dead of Greece, evoking the image of a classical paradise beyond the eastern horizon. Here too, as with
    Epicureanism, Vespucci’s casual antique analogy becomes a defining model for the New World of Utopia. Budé’s
    mythological localization coincides with or perhaps prefigures the thinking of several key writers on the New World,
    specifically Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo, who in his<i> La Historia general de las Indias</i><i> (</i>1535)
    hypothesizes that the West Indies were actually the legendary Hesperides, island home of the demigoddess guardians
    of Atalanta’s golden apples that was also associated with the legendary Arcadia.<a href="#_edn28"

    modeling, More did not neglect this crucial motivation and an Asian geographical identity is distinctly present in
    Utopia, even if thematically subordinate to antiquity. We know that Utopia must be located within proximity to the
    Indies, because as More tells us in his initial impressions of Hythlodaeus, that at the end of his sojourn in
    Utopia, “By remarkable good luck he was on a ship that was driven by a storm to Ceylon, and from there he made his
    way to Calcutta.”<a href="#_edn33"
                        name="_ednref33"
                        title=""><sup>[33]</sup></a> While this detail suggests proximity to the Indian subcontinent, a
    further clue– in Greek of course– also points to a convergence of the Utopian New World and India. In the
    <a href="https://www.rct.uk/collection/1086970/utopia"
       target="_blank">Utopian cipher facing the frontispiece</a> of text, there is also a poem by the Utopian poet
    laureate Anemolius, which is transcribed and then translated into Latin at the bottom of the page. The word
    translated into Latin as “philosopher” is phonetically transcribed from Utopian (supposedly evolved from Greek) as
    “gymnosophaon,” a classical term that commonly referred to philosophers of India.<a href="#_edn34"
                                                                                        name="_ednref34"

    Lastly, there is a repeated motif of Persian proximity throughout <i>Utopia</i>. It begins with the Persia-adjacent
    land of the Polylerlites, which Hythlodaeus cites in his Book One, and repeats in the language, history, and culture
    of Utopia: though Utopian retains “traces of Greek”, it “resembles Persian in other respects.” In discussing the
    country’s founder, Utopus, Hythlodaeus reveals that it was previously called “Abraxa,”<a href="#_edn35"
                                                                                             name="_ednref35"
                                                                                             title=""><sup>[35]</sup></a>
    and he twice names “Mithra” as the common name for god in an otherwise religiously heterogenous
    society.<a href="#_edn36"
               name="_ednref36"
               title=""><sup>[36]</sup></a> Not only does Persia represent the Asian periphery of the ancient
    Mediterranean world, but the invocation of gnosticism through Abraxas and the esoteric spiritual traditions of
    Mithraism proposes a society with a similar origin to Latin West, but several steps removed in its expression. Just
    as gnosticism straddles a nebulous line between the Christian and the Pagan, the Utopians are both familiar and
    foreign, occupying a physical space that is just over the horizons, known but not seen, both east and west
    simultaneously.</p>
<p>The emphasis on Greek culture over any other antique identity speaks to a divide in humanistic circles that pitted
    the philosophy of Greece against that of Rome, seeing them as two fundamentally incompatible and opposing
    philosophies, rather than a concatenating progression in human thought.<a href="#_edn37"
                                                                              name="_ednref37"
                                                                              title=""><sup>[37]</sup></a> In the midst
    of this culture war, the New World came to act as a mirror of whichever antique virtues or vices lent credence to a
    chosen intellectual or political polemic, and vice versa. In an anonymous 1541 tract entitled <i>La Pazzia </i>(“Folly”),
    which both in title and content echoed the anti-Ciceronian argument of Erasmus’s <i>In Praise of Folly</i>, the
    author– sometimes thought to be the translator of the first Italian vernacular edition of <i>Utopia, </i>Ortensio
    Landi<a href="#_edn38"
            name="_ednref38"
            title=""><sup>[38]</sup></a>– appears to follow More’s lead in idealizing the Epicurean qualities of New
    World natives, stating romantically,</p>
<p>“How happy people would be without these so-called wise men [the “wisdom” of Ciceronian
    <i>patria </i>and <i>gloria</i>] can easily be judged from the life and customs of the newly-discovered peoples of
    the West-Indies…[They] are happy without laws, without letters, without so-called wise men; they don’t value gold or
    jewels; they don’t know avarice, or ambition… they are nourished by what the ground produces without any
    cultivation… as in the Republic of Plato, everything is in common… they live in perpetual love and grace, just as in
    that fortunate and truly golden age of Saturn in ancient times.”<a
            href="#_edn39"
            name="_ednref39"
            title=""><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>
<p>However, in the case of Oviedo's<i> Historia, </i>this innocence is stripped to expose the immorality of natives’
    marital and sexual practices, cannibalism, and murder: “idolatrías y errores” that echo the paganism of antiquity in
    a “religion of the Devil.”<a href="#_edn40"
                                 name="_ednref40"
                                 title=""><sup>[40]</sup></a> Oviedo’s objectives in drawing these parallels differ
    vastly from the anonymous author of <i>La Pazzia </i>and from More; he deploys a number of strategies for
    determining the origins of the New World that justify Spanish conquest. Oviedo uses the same qualities that Vespucci
    encapsulated as “Epicurean” to advocate for subjugation through evangelization.</p>
<p> Inevitably, this dual Ancient/New World imaginary does not comprise a one-way trajectory for which <i>Utopia </i>merely
    bears witness. In what may be the only contemporary artistic reference to <i>Utopia</i> beyond the illustrations of
    the first and second editions, a curious print indicates the conflicting characterizations of the New World using
    <i>Utopia</i> as a pretext. The panoramic scene depicts a bloody battle between clothed and nearly naked men beneath
    the towering branches of a pine forest. The nude men have neither exoticizing costume beyond their nakedness nor
    distinctly non-European morphology, and in a <a
            href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/404505"
            target="_blank">first state print of the woodcut</a> in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
    New York, the only clearly identifying information is the woodcutter’s mark. In a second state exhibited in Leuven
    in 2016, however, a poem has been added beneath the image that identifies the nude men as hailing from Utopia, ‘not
    far from Morian’:</p>
<p style="margin: 8%"> Ain Insel haißt Utopion / Die leyt nit ferr von Morian<br> Dag[e]schach ain sollichs schlagen /
    Hundert tausent hort ich sagen <br>Doch ist es eben vil der Jar / Das ich gelaub es sey nit war<br> Wann wie wolt
    ain nackend man / Ain angelegten pawren b[e]stan…<a
            href="#_edn41"
            name="_ednref41"
            title=""><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>
<p>Perhaps the woodcutter is making an early reference to Morpion, a land later cited as existing a quarter league from
    the Rio de la Plata by André Thevet in his travel account <i>Les singularitez de la France antarctique</i><i> </i>(The
    New Found World, or Antarctike). He states the Spanish encountered wild men nearby<a href="#_edn42"
                                                                                         name="_ednref42"
                                                                                         title=""><sup>[42]</sup></a>;
    could these wild men be the woodcutter’s Utopians? In any case, his connection to the text of <i>Utopia</i> is not
    arbitrary. Hans Lützelberger, identified by his monogram, was employed by More’s Basel publisher Johann Froben, and
    worked with Hans Holbein the Younger, brother of More’s 1518 illustrator Ambrosius Holbein in illustrating
    Reformation bibles and humanist tracts.<a
            href="#_edn43"
            name="_ednref43"
            title=""><sup>[43]</sup></a> He may have been intimately familiar with the Utopian narrative and other
    travel accounts through these associations. The choice to associate More’s sophisticated, peaceful Utopians with
    naked, warlike drunkards (a figure at the far left curiously holds a beer tankard) speaks to the text’s involvement
    in an ongoing dialogue between reports of the New World and the paradigms projected onto it by the curious
    intellectual circles of Europe. Where More projected the virtues of Platonic and Epicurean antiquity onto New World
    natives, here we see something more akin to Oviedo’s “idolotrías” projected back onto Utopia. But even this poem
    remains ambiguous, calling into question the veracity of eyewitnesses to the Utopian battle: “Hundert tausent hort
    ich sagen / Doch ist es eben vil der Jar / Das ich gelaub es sey nit war” states (in rough translation) that though
    “a hundred thousand heard [the story] told / it was many years ago / I don’t believe it happened.”<a href="#_edn44"
                                                                                                         name="_ednref44"

<p>Michel Foucault tells us that “Utopias are sites with no real place. They are sites that have a general relation of
    direct or inverted analogy with the real space of Society. They present society itself in a perfected form, or else
    society turned upside down, but in any case these utopias are fundamentally unreal spaces.”<a href="#_edn45"
                                                                                                  name="_ednref45"
                                                                                                  title=""><sup>[45]</sup></a>
    This may be a serious mischaracterization of Thomas More’s Utopia<i>. </i>Its legacy has outgrown its original
    context to become the namesake of a vast cross-disciplinary genre of visionary worlds that quite often exist outside
    of physical space as Foucault suggests: projections of desire that passively represent an impossible ideal. But <i>Utopia </i>problematizes
    place and space in an inherently different way. More’s utopia is full of improbable ideals and radical notions like
    any other, some that are shockingly revolutionary even to a 21st century reader. But the space it occupies, though
    unresolved, is real: the New World. This New World is not truly new; it is merely the unseen reaches of the Old
    World that have long existed over the horizon, now beginning to come into view. While his primary intention may be
    to promote the virtues of a society modeled on Greek philosophy rather than to discern the identity of new lands or
    attempt an anthropological portrait, the setting is key to rendering its improbability believable, appropriating the
    New World’s inherent geographical, topological, and cultural mutability, already rich in contradiction and
    fantastical detail. He utilizes this manifold imaginary to disguise the fictitiousness of Hythlodaeus’s account. The
    physical distance of America and the temporal distance of antiquity become analogous to one another, just as the
    north/south axis of the known-to-unknown becomes interchangeable with the axis of east to west and the Elysian
    fields converge with India; Hythlodaeus himself becomes an analogue for Ulysses and Vespucci simultaneously. Rather
    than occupying a “fundamentally unreal space,” Utopia occupies a real space that simply has yet to be defined in
    fixed terms and so can realistically be all things at once. Unlike the utopias of Foucault, this space is not a
    passive mirror. It has its own evolving identity that reflects back, changing and influencing those working to
    define it. </p>

        of the <i>Cosmographiae </i>in large part because of his unique interests and skillset as a Graecophile like
        More. In exploring the ways in which this manifests, Lester proposes a similar interest in wordplay that
        exploits the similarity between Vespucci’s given name, Amerigo, and an array of Greek neologisms directly
        analogous to “Utopia.” On pages 356-358 he states “The name may also contain a play on meros, a Greek word that
        can sometimes be translated as “place”. Here Amerigen becomes A-meri-gen, or “No-place-land”: not a bad way to
        describe a previously unnamed continent whose geography is still uncertain,” and when commenting on the <i>Cosmographiae’</i>s
        influence on More on page 377, he observes, “The name Utopia itself- a word coined by More from Greek roots to
        mean “no-place” (ou-topia), “good place” (eu-topia), or both- bears an uncanny likeness to the name America.
        Both are three-syllable coinages derived from Greek, both identify a previously unknown region across the ocean
        and suggest it may be a kind of Nowhere Land (A-meri-gen, or “no-place-land,” and ou-topia or “no-place”), and
        both involve a private play on words intended for a small audience of highly educated humanists.” </p>
