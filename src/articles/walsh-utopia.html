<h1>
    Antiquity Beyond the Horizon: Thomas More's <i>Utopia</i> and the New World
</h1>
<h2>Grace Walsh</h2>
<p>
    On Vavassore's 1558 edition of the Caspar Vopel world map, just below the
    continental label of AMERICA NOVA ORBIS PARS, the mapmaker provides this
    observation: "<i
>Incolae Americae sua in libertate vivunt nullique obedient," </i
>("The inhabitants of America live in their freedom, obeying no one"). The
    lifestyle of the people of the New World, first encountered by Europeans on
    the cusp of the sixteenth century, was a lightning rod for the European
    imagination. Seen as simultaneously idyllic and irrational, hedonistic and
    naïve, the intellectual and creative minds of the period grappled with the
    geographical, philosophical, social, and spiritual character of these people,
    through both word and image. Conceived some forty years before Vopel voiced
    his own such fascination on the cartographic plane, Sir Thomas More's
    apocryphal <i>Utopia </i>blended fact and fiction, satire and sermon, to
    create a New World account that coyly straddles the boundaries between
    plausible travel testimony, absurd moral fantasy, and political treatise.
</p>
<p>
    The story, written as an audience between More, fellow real-life humanist
    Peter Giles and fictional character Raphael Hythlodaeus Organized into a
    two-book structure, Hythlodaeus first expounds on a critique of the inequity
    of European&#8211;predominantly English&#8211;society, and then offers a
    description of the island commonwealth of Utopia as a moralizing
    counterexample. According to his account, after staying behind with a
    contingent from Amerigo Vespucci's fourth voyage in the New World and
    traveling westward through diversely peopled lands, Hythlodaeus came upon
    Utopia, an island society with a sophisticated political, economic, and social
    system based around communitarian principles: property in common, a disdain
    for gold and precious stones, religious tolerance, pacifism; equal
    distribution of labor, and a strict penal system. First published in 1516,
    <i>Utopia'</i>s New World setting has been the subject of scrutiny as
    centuries of Morean scholars have attempted to untangle its course among the
    many philosophical threads woven into this improbable tale.
</p>
<p>
    While the references, both direct and indirect, to the details of Vespucci's
    letters (see <a href="#weitzman-armeria">Weitzman essay on Buti frescoes and Vespucci</a>) are clear in the
    text, there has nonetheless been much debate about the extent to which
    accounts of transatlantic exploration shaped the overall content and motifs of
    <i>Utopia. </i>One argument is that More's vision of a peaceful, orderly
    commonwealth is far too estranged from Vespucci's description of naked,
    uncouth, and sometimes violent New World natives, and so this inspiration must
    have been incidental at best.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> Many
    scholars note that a clear emphasis on Greek culture and philosophy points to
    ancient authors such as Plato, Homer, and Lucian as More's primary influences,
    rather than any contemporary writing.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a>
    More certainly strove to promote ancient philosophy as a guiding principle for
    scholarly thought and rhetoric, and his circle particularly privileged Greek
    writing and philosophy over Roman.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a> As
    a noted Greek and Latin scholar, More was better known for his translation of
    Lucian than the text of <i>Utopia.</i
><a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a> However, these superficial
    incompatibilities with the worldly concerns of explorers' accounts do not
    preclude the importance of the New World as both a physical and conceptual
    setting for the Utopians. Rather, More's text often dramatizes the ways in
    which accounts from the New World were fitted into existing paradigms of
    geography and world history derived from antique models.
    <i>Utopia </i>repeatedly reveals and develops these paradigms to exploit the
    shifting terrain of new geographical discoveries.
</p>
<p>
    Initially published in Leuven in Latin, several editions of <i>Utopia</i> were
    printed in More's lifetime accompanied by a group of appendices that
    reinforced the false authenticity of Hythlodaeus's story. The text is
    introduced as a true account related in person to More in the company of Peter
    Giles. Their mutual friend Erasmus of Rotterdam helped gather letters from
    accomplished scholars from their circle to preface the book along with a
    <a
            href="https://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/.a/6a00d8341c464853ef01b7c863db20970b-popup"
    >map of the island </a
    >(the original designer of which is unknown) and a poem by the supposed poet
    laureate of Utopia with a Utopian-to-Latin translation. In the second edition
    of 1518, this map was
    <a href="https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:11177599"
    >updated by Ambrosius Holbein</a
    >, who also provided an

            target="_blank"
    >illustration of Hythlodaeus</a
    >
    in audience with More and Giles. The various letters that accompanied the
    text&#8211; from Giles to Hieronymus van Busleyden, from More to Giles; from
    Erasmus to printer Johann Froben, and later from Parisian scholar Gillaume
    Budé to Thomas Lupset in the 1518 edition&#8211; all refer to the content of
    the book as though it were fact, adding to the illusion of truth. The most
    compelling component of the ruse, however, is the text's references to the
    widely published letters of Amerigo Vespucci.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Utopia</i> was written approximately eleven years after Vespucci's letter
    to Piero Soderini describing his four journeys was first published in Florence
    circa 1505-1506 under the title
    <i
    >Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci delle isole nuovamente trovate in quatro suoi
        viaggi</i
    >. The following year, Martin Waldseemüller published his historic
    <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/2003626426/" target="_blank"
    >Universalis Cosmographia</a
    >
    map depicting an insular western Atlantic landmass titled "America" for the
    first time, in honor of Vespucci. A Latin translation of the
    <i>Lettera</i> was included in the map's accompanying treatise, the
    <i>Cosmographiae Introductio</i>, and several historians have made compelling
    arguments that it is this version of Vespucci's letter that More accessed.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a>
    The letter's denouement of the fourth
    voyage serves as the point of departure for Hythlodaeus's account, creating a
    deliberate air of factual continuity. As Vespucci reaches the conclusion of
    his letter to Piero Soderini, he states:
</p>
<blockquote>
    Having done all this, we decided to return to Portugal, which was on a course
    northeast by north; we left behind twenty-four men to remain in the fort,
    supplies for six months, twelve mortars and many other weapons; and we
    pacified all the people of that land, of whom no mention has been made for
    this voyage, but not because we did not see and have dealings with countless
    people there: for thirty of our men went forty leagues inland, where I myself
    saw so many things I must delay relating, saving them for my
    <i>Four Journeys.</i><a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
    This intriguingly open-ended description provided an aperture for More to
    insert his character's account into a record that was still under scrutiny.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a>
    In the opening pages of
    <i>Utopia</i>, Giles introduces Hythlodaeus to More, making direct reference
    to both Vespucci's exact words:
</p>
<blockquote>
    He went everywhere with [Amerigo Vespucci] throughout the last three of his
    four voyages&mdash; the ones that everyone is now reading about. Except, on the last
    voyage, he did not come home with him. He begged and even threatened Amerigo
    until he agreed to let hims stay behind as one of the twenty-four who were to
    be left garrisoning a fort at the furthest point to which their journey had
    taken them.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Other continuities with Vespucci's letters became interpretive in their
    descriptions of the peoples and environs of newly discovered territories. In
    some attempts to reconcile discrepancy between More's highly civilized (by
    European standards) Utopians and Vespucci's descriptions of New World natives
    that range from the nnaïve to the monstrous, there is debate that the form of
    the Utopian commonwealth draws on Vespucci's choice of classicizing terms for
    what he viewed as an essentially primitive society. In particular, amidst
    stories of cannibalism, lascivious sexual practices, murder, and naïveté (some
    of which was illustrated in no uncertain terms in woodcuts by Johannes Grüninger
    that accompanied the 1509 German edition of the <i>Lettera</i> he nonetheless
    describes the new territories as a paradise and the people within them as
    "Epicurean." A particular passage of interest occurs in a fragmentary letter
    by Vespucci referred to as the "Ridolfi Fragment":
</p>
<blockquote>
    ...those inhabitants prize neither gold nor other riches which we value and hold
    in great esteem, arguing that contrary to this we said we bought slaves from
    themÉ. for, as I said their life is rather more Epicurean than Stoic or
    Academic, because, as I state, they hold no private property, nor have they
    divisions into kingdoms or provinces: in conclusion, all that they have they
    hold in common...<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Later in his letter to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de'Medici he states again that
    "They live according to nature, and might be called Epicureans rather than
    Stoics."<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[10]</a>
</p>
<p>
    While this term is far gentler than some of the more barbaric
    characterizations of indigenous people, it neatly encapsulates a number of
    Vespucci's observations: that these people were pleasure-seeking,
    non-Christian, and living in a state of prelapsarian naïveté for which an
    idyllic antiquity provided a convenient model. Thomas More liberally expands
    this construct beginning with Utopians' philosophy of pleasure, their primary
    ethic of happiness, stating:
</p>
<blockquote>
    They discuss virtue and pleasure, but their main topic of debate, their
    primary concern, is the understanding of human happiness ...they hold that its
    happiness cannot be identified with pleasure, then at least pleasure is the
    main factor that makes for happiness...<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11"
>[11]</a
>
</blockquote>
<p>
    He further applies an Epicurean model in his description of their legal and
    penal systems. The harsh consequences for lawbreakers&#8211;slavery, exile or
    death&#8211; rely on a universal and idealistic ethic of civic obligation
    where social accountability and self-interest are intertwined.
</p>
<p>
    Vespucci's letters may have left an opening for a Classical or Hellenistic
    imaginary of a New World society, but his explicit references to antiquity are
    limited. Nevertheless, More adopts and develops this model in a way that
    transcends analogy, devising a literal Mediterranean origin for the people of
    Utopia:
</p>
<blockquote>
    According to their history books, they had no information whatever regarding
    our part of the world (they call us the Ultra-equatorials) before I made
    landfall there, with one exception. Twelve-hundred years ago a ship, which had
    been blown off course by a storm, was wrecked on the island of Utopia. Some
    Romans and Egyptians were tossed onto the shore and remained on the island for
    the rest of their lives.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
    A significant tool that More uses to forge this heritage is language and
    wordplay, noting the the Utopians' ease in developing proficiency in Greek in
    one passage <a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</a> and later explaining
    that the Utopians must be descended from the Greeks because their language is
    etymologically similar. <a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[14]</a> This
    justifies the many Greek pun names for locations, demonyms, and characters
    that populate Utopia. Most significant among them is the name for Utopia
    itself, which elicits two simultaneous translations:
    Eutopia(&#949;&#965;&#964;&#959;¹ &#959;&#962;), meaning "good place", and
    Ou-topia (&#959;&#965;&#964;&#959;¹ &#959;&#962;), meaning "no place". Raphael
    Hythlodaeus' name is a humorous compound of hythlo and daeus (&#948;&#945;
    &#953;&#969;&#957;, &#965;&#952;&#955;&#959;&#962;), meaning peddler or
    distributor of nonsense. These tongue-in-cheek epithets are found throughout,
    from the Utopian capital, <i>Amaurot</i> (&#945;&#956;&#945;
    &#965;&#961;&#959;&#962;, "Unknown" or "Dark" City), to a fictional society
    Hythlodaeus encountered in his travels through Persia called the Polylerites
    (¹ &#959;&#955;&#965;, &#955;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#962;, "people of much
    nonsense.")<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[15]</a>
</p>
<p>
    These names are couched in a dry humor that hints at the murky authenticity of
    the account, but they also reflect the geographical ambiguity of the New World
    in European consciousness. The veracity of accounts from New World journeys
    did not go undisputed (even Vespucci's letters), and the understanding of the
    New World's spatial relationship to both Europe and known Asian territories
    evolved and was adapted throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in response to
    changing information. Historian Toby Lester has suggested that More's use of
    wordplay, particularly the double meaning of "Utopia", may have been directly
    inspired by Waldseemüller’s <i>Cosmographiae Introductio</i>, where writer
    Matthias Ringmann's historic choice to christen the New World "America" may
    have employed the same logic of the "no-place" as clever subtext to its overt
    association with Amerigo Vespucci.<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[16]</a> For Vespucci, the eastern edge of
    what is now called South America represented the confluence of paradise (link
    to DRACONIS entry), heathendom, and the far more mundane trading pathway to
    Malacca.<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17">[17]</a> For More, these
    overlapping identities spoke to a mythological reality.
</p>
<p>
    As part of his sleight-of-hand with the truth, Thomas More leaves the location
    of the island of Utopia to the imagination of the reader, stating in his
    preface letter to Peter Giles that he "forgot to ask ...just where in the New
    World Utopia is to be found."<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18">[18]</a>
    Keeping its location secret allowed it to reside in a liminal state where the
    mythical and the real coexist. Nonetheless he localizes Utopia using a
    <a
            href="http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/blogs/world-map-after-macrobius"
            target="_blank"
    >zonal model</a>
    of the earth. Unlike Vespucci, who refers to passing through the "torrid"
    equatorial zone only to refute its supposed hostility<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19">[19]</a>, More refers
    implicitly to the
    zonal model and reinforces it through descriptions of the harsh equatorial
    landscape:
</p>
<blockquote>
    To be sure, south of the equator, and indeed on either side of it for almost
    as far as the sun is distant from the earth, there lie vast empty deserts,
    scorched by the perpetual heat. In every direction the view is gloomy and
    dismal. Nature is wild and uncultivated. There are savage beasts and dangerous
    serpents, and a few men who are no less savage and dangerous than the
    creatures they live among. But if you keep traveling, slowly nature becomes
    more friendly. The climate is less harsh, the sun less scorching, the
    creatures les predatory. At length you reach civilization again."<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20">[20]</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Describing the journey through the torrid zone and beyond, More fills in the
    gaps between zonal geography and the Greek and New World imaginaries by
    describing the monsters found in the torrid zone in mythological terms:
    "Scyllas, or rapacious Celaenos, or man-eating Laestrygonians, or other
    monsters just as remarkable.<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21">[21]</a> Expressed in recognizable terms,
    the man-eating giants and sea serpents of Odysseus and the Amazons of Heracles
    neatly enjoin with reports of Patagonian giants, Amazons, and cannibals that
    populate literature and cartography charting the exploration of the New World,
    including the Vopel map.
</p>
<p>
    The Utopians themselves also endorse, albeit obliquely, a zonal construct of
    the world. Despite having "no information whatever regarding [Europe],"
    Hythlodaeus reports, "they call us the Ultra-equatorials."<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22">[22]</a> More does not
    expand on Utopian
    notions of "Ultra-equatorial" geography, but paints an overall picture of a
    people with scientific and philosophical competence on par with the antique
    Mediterranean, particularly in "music, logic, arithmetic, and geometry," but
    astronomy above all else.<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23">[23]</a> The
    zonal model being based originally on Pythagorean constructs and having
    evolved through a series of ancient adaptations concluding in Macrobius,<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24">[24]</a>
    it is reasonable for the reader to
    believe that the Utopians have come to parallel conclusions about the
    antipodes as the Europeans, and the reference to "Ultra-equatorials" posits
    the equator as the boundary for that reflection. Beyond that frontier, the
    residents of one side become both mirror and myth to the other, occupying
    antipodal temperate zones divided by the wasteland.
</p>
<p>
    Guillaume Budé's letter to Thomas Lupset prefacing the 1518 edition of
    <i>Utopia</i> suggests a specific place that superimposes the mythical on the
    real:
</p>
<blockquote>
    [Utopia is] surely one of the Fortunate Isles, which may lie close to the
    Elysian Fields- Hythloday, as More himself says, has not yet told us exactly
    where it is located... a community comfortable with its own customs and
    possessions, blessed with innocence and leading what we might call a heavenly
    life- Utopia is not in heaven, it is true, but it is certainly far superior to
    the muck that pervades the known world... Utopia, an island in the New World...<a
        href="#_edn25"
        name="_ednref25"
>[25]</a
>
</blockquote>
<p>
    This may be adapted from Vespucci, who no less than three times in his letters
    refers to the "Fortunate isles" as a key portal through which he passed toward
    the New World, though in his case he clarifies it as another name for the
    Canary Islands.<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26">[26]</a> Budé's letter
    appears to refer, along with Elysium, to the lands of the virtuous dead of
    Greece, evoking the image of a classical paradise beyond the eastern horizon.
    Here too, as with Epicureanism, Vespucci's casual antique analogy becomes a
    defining model for the New World of Utopia.
</p>
<p>
    Budé's mythological localization coincides with or perhaps prefigures the
    thinking of several key writers on the New World, specifically BartolomŽ de
    las Casas whose <i>Historia de Las Indias</i> (1527) hypothesizes that Plato's
    Atlantis was not a fable but a reality proven by the existence of the New
    World, a massive continent west of the mouth of the Strait of Gibraltar.<a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27">[27]</a>
    Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo
    hypothesizes in his <i>La Historia general de las Indias</i> (1535) that the
    West Indies were actually the legendary Hesperides, island home of the
    demigoddess guardians of Atalanta's golden apples, which was also associated
    with the legendary Arcadia.<a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28">[28]</a> The
    common location of these mythological analogues&#8211; Elysium, Fortunata,
    Atlantis, the Hesperides&#8211; beyond the western horizon of the
    Mediterranean creates a plausibility born of geographic consensus and
    convergence with the New World discoveries. In maps of the 16th century,
    including the 1520
    <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Sch%2525C3%2525B6ner_globe%2523/media/File:Sch%2525C3%2525B6ner_globe_1520_western_hemisphere.jpg"

    >Sebastian Münster map
    </a>
    and Caspar Vopel's, the Hesperides can be found in varying positions in the
    Atlantic ocean. Vopel goes a step further in mythologizing the Atlantic by
    including a less heavenly destination&#8211; <i>Gorgonum insulae</i>, islands
    of the Gorgons&#8211; just west of Madeira.
</p>
<p>
    This shifting horizon also subtly reorients More's vector of the
    known-to-unknown world from the zonal north/south axis to one wherein
    continental Europe no longer represents a clear western extreme and the border
    between a new west and the known, ancient east is undefined. In Vopel's map
    this is expressed through the visual geographic continuity between an American
    and Asian landmass. In his letters Vespucci states clearly that he has
    travelled to the "Indian regions"<a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29">[29]</a> in a quest for passage to
    Taprobane<a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30">[30]</a> or Malacca,<a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31">[31]</a> and
    despite his overwhelming Greek
    modeling for <i>Utopia</i>, More did not neglect this crucial motivation; an
    Asian geographical identity is emphatically present. We know that Utopia must
    be located within proximity to the Indies, because as More tells us in his
    initial impressions of Hythlodaeus, that at the end of his sojourn in Utopia,
    "By remarkable good luck he was on a ship that was driven by a storm to
    Ceylon, and from there he made his way to Calcutta."<a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32">[32]</a> While this detail
    suggests
    proximity to the Indian subcontinent, a further clue&#8211; in Greek of
    course&#8211; also points to a convergence of the Utopian New World and India.
    In the
    <a href="https://www.rct.uk/collection/1086970/utopia" target="_blank"
    >Utopian cipher facing the frontispiece
    </a>
    of text, there is also a poem by the Utopian poet laureate Anemolius, which is
    transcribed and then translated into Latin at the bottom of the page. The word
    translated into Latin as "philosopher" is phonetically transcribed from
    Utopian (supposedly evolved from Greek) as "gymnosophaon," a classical term
    that commonly referred to philosophers of India.<a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33">[33]</a>
</p>
<p>
    Lastly, there is a repeated motif of Persian proximity throughout
    <i>Utopia</i>. It begins with the Persia-adjacent land of the Polylerlites,
    which Hythlodaeus cites in his Book One, and repeats in the language, history,
    and culture of Utopia: though Utopian retains "traces of Greek", it "resembles
    Persian in other respects." In discussing the country's founder, Utopus,
    Hythlodaeus reveals that it was previously called " Abraxa,"<a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34">[34]</a> and he twice
    names "Mithra" as the
    common name for god in an otherwise religiously heterogenous society.<a href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35">[35]</a>
    This explicit Persian proximity is
    subtly enhanced by the invocation of near eastern gnosticism through Abraxas
    and the esoteric spiritual traditions of Mithraism but it also proposes a
    society with a composite culture that blends features of the familiar and
    foreign. The Utopians occupy a physical space that is just over the horizons,
    known but not seen, where the newly discovered extremes of east and west
    converge onto a unified identity.
</p>
<p>
    Inevitably, this multivalent antique/Asian/American imaginary does not
    comprise a one-way trajectory for which <i>Utopia </i>merely bears witness. In
    what may be the only contemporary artistic reference to <i>Utopia</i> beyond
    the illustrations of the first and second editions, a curious print indicates
    the conflicting characterizations of the New World using <i>Utopia</i> as a
    pretext. The panoramic scene depicts a bloody battle between clothed and
    nearly naked men beneath the towering branches of a pine forest. The nude men
    have neither exoticizing costume beyond their nakedness nor distinctly
    non-European morphology, and in a
    <a
            href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/404505"
            target="_blank"
    >first state print of the woodcut
    </a>
    in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the only
    clearly identifying information is the woodcutter's mark. In a second state
    exhibited in Leuven in 2016, however, a poem has been added beneath the image
    that identifies the nude men as hailing from Utopia, 'not far from Morian':
</p>
<blockquote>Ain Insel hai§t Utopion/ Die leyt nit ferr von Morian</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    Da g[e] schach ain sollichs schlagen/ Hundert tausent hort ich sagen
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    Doch ist es eben vil der Jar/ Das ich gelaub es sey nit war
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    Wann wie wolt ain nackend man/ Ain angelegten pawren b[e] stan...<a href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36">[36]</a>
</blockquote>

    Perhaps the woodcutter is making an early reference to Morpion, a land later
    cited as existing a quarter league from the Rio de la Plata by André Thevet
    in his travel account <i>Les singularitez de la France antarctique</i> (The
    New Found World, or Antarctike). He states the Spanish encountered wild men
    nearby<a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37">[37]</a>; could these wild men be
    the woodcutter's Utopians? In any case, his connection to the milieu of
    <i>Utopia</i> is not arbitrary. Hans LŸtzelberger, identified by his monogram,
    was employed by More's Basel publisher Johann Froben , and worked with Hans
    Holbein the Younger, brother of More's 1518 illustrator Ambrosius Holbein in
    illustrating Reformation bibles and humanist tracts.<a href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38">[38]</a> He may have been
    intimately
    familiar with the Utopian narrative and other contemporary travel accounts.
    The choice to depict More's sophisticated, peaceful Utopians as naked, warlike
    drunkards (a figure at the far left curiously holds a beer tankard) speaks to
    the text's involvement in an ongoing dialogue between reports of the New World
    and the paradigms projected onto it by the curious intellectual circles of
    Europe. Lützelberger’s Utopians seem far closer to the people described in
    Oviedo's <i>Historia</i>, who find that the " idolatr’as y errores" of the
    indigenous Americans echoed the paganism of antiquity in a "religion of the
    Devil."<a href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39">[39]</a> The woodcutter's poem
    remains ambiguous, perhaps alluding to the questionable veracity of
    conflicting New World testimonies and their interpretations by skeptically
    dismissing eyewitnesses to his invented Utopian battle: "Hundert tausent hort
    ich sagen/ Doch ist es eben vil der Jar/Das ich gelaub es sey nit war" states
    (in rough translation) that though "a hundred thousand heard [the story] told/
    it was many years ago/ I don't believe it happened."<a href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40">[40]</a>
</p>
<p>
    Michel Foucault tells us that "Utopias are sites with no real place. They are
    sites that have a general relation of direct or inverted analogy with the real
    space of Society. They present society itself in a perfected form, or else
    society turned upside down, but in any case these utopias are fundamentally
    unreal spaces." <a href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41">[41]</a> This may be a
    serious mischaracterization of Thomas More's <i>Utopia</i>. Its legacy has
    outgrown its original context to become the namesake of a vast
    cross-disciplinary genre of visionary worlds that quite often exist outside of
    physical space as Foucault suggests: projections of desire that passively
    represent an impossible ideal. But <i>Utopia </i>problematizes place and space
    in an inherently different way. More's utopia is full of improbable ideals and
    radical notions like any other, some that are shockingly revolutionary even to
    a twentyfirst century reader. But the space it occupies, though unresolved, is real:
    the New World.
</p>
<p>
    This New World is not truly new; it is merely the unseen reaches of the Old
    World that have long existed over the horizon, now beginning to come into
    view. While his primary intention may be to promote the virtues of a society
    modeled on Greek philosophy rather than to discern the identity of new lands
    or attempt an anthropological portrait, the setting is key to rendering its
    improbability believable, appropriating the New World's inherent geographical,
    topological, and cultural mutability, already rich in contradiction and
    fantastical detail. He utilizes this manifold imaginary to disguise the
    fictitiousness of Hythlodaeus's account. The physical distance of America and
    the temporal distance of antiquity become analogous to one another, just as
    the north/south axis of the known-to-unknown becomes interchangeable with the
    axis of east to west and the Elysian fields converge with India; Hythlodaeus
    himself becomes an analogue for Ulysses and Vespucci simultaneously. Rather
    than occupying a "fundamentally unreal space," Utopia occupies a real space
    that simply has yet to be defined in fixed terms and so can realistically be
    all things at once. Unlike the utopias of Foucault, this space is not a
    passive mirror. It has its own evolving identity that reflects back, changing
    and influencing those working to define it.

        claims of Vespucci's as a false testimony, particularly by Bartolomé de las
        Casas, amounted to proto-nationalist rivalry between Spain and Florence, but
        it nonetheless cast doubt on the veracity of Vespucci's account in the

        >356-358; 377. Lester argues for Ringmann as the author of the
        <i>Cosmographiae </i>in large part because of his unique interests and
        skillset as a Graecophile like More. In exploring the ways in which this
        manifests, Lester proposes a similar interest in wordplay that exploits the
        similarity between Vespucci's given name, Amerigo, and an array of Greek
        neologisms directly analogous to "Utopia." On pages 356-358 he states "The
        name may also contain a play on meros, a Greek word that can sometimes be
        translated as "place". Here Amerigen becomes A-meri-gen, or "No-place-land":
        not a bad way to describe a previously unnamed continent whose geography is
        still uncertain," and when commenting on the <i>Cosmographiae'</i>s
        influence on More on page 377, he observes, "The name Utopia itself- a word
        coined by More from Greek roots to mean "no-place" (ou-topia), "good place"
        (eu-topia), or both- bears an uncanny likeness to the name America. Both are
        three-syllable coinages derived from Greek, both identify a previously
        unknown region across the ocean and suggest it may be a kind of Nowhere Land
        (A-meri-gen, or "no-place-land," and ou-topia or "no-place"), and both
        involve a private play on words intended for a small audience of highly
        educated humanists."
