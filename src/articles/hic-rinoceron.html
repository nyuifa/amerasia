<h1>Hic Rinoceron</h1>

<p>
    In the sixteenth-century frescoes by Lodovico Buti in Florenceâ€™s armory hall
    or <em>armeria</em>, the rhino, native to Asia and Africa, is shown beneath a
    fresco containing American imagery, raising the question: is the scene above
    the rhino meant to represent America, Asia, Africa, or all at once?
