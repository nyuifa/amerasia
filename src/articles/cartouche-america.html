    America, although Amerigo Vespucci called the land the continent of the New
    World, is named fortuitously for its discoverer, Amerigo Vespucci. However,
    the Spanish presently call it <i>terra firma, </i>and on account of this it is
    said, not undeservedly, to be the fourth part of the earth. He went beyond the
    equator, where he observed a people and their customs, the civilization, the
    fertility of the soil, the mild weather of the air, and the wholesomeness of
    the heavens. He swears that he found regions more cultivated, and these same
    places were more populated with inhabitants than nations anywhere else are, if
    one were to look at Asia, Europe, or Africa, and the rest of the world. Some
    of the inhabitants copulate promiscuously, with no consideration for ties of
    kinship, and others take as many wives as pleases them. Others still eat human
    flesh, so much so that fathers eat their sons and in turn children eat their
    parents, as chance and happenstance would have it. They say that for them, it
    is no different than eating the animals of the sea.
