<h1>Chatay</h1>

    As Peiyue Wu’s essay “Tangut, Cathay, and Mangi on Sixteenth-Century World
    Maps” discusses at length (link to WU essay), ideas about Cathay (northern
    China, but often intended to mean China itself) were at the center of
    Amerasian understandings of the world; a great variety of sixteenth-century
    world maps showed its location as proximate to Mexico. In 1493, Columbus
    described the lands he had reached “in the province of Cathay” (<em
>la provincia de Catayo</em
>).<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> Around the end of the fifteenth
    century, John Cabot was convinced that during his voyages along the coast of
    North America that “if I should sail by way of the Northwest, I should by a
    shorter tract come into India…not thinking to find any other land that that of
    Cathay.”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a> Peter Martyr reported that
    when Vicente Yáñez and Pinzón and his nephew Arias Pinzón landed in Brazil and
    sailed along the coast of Paria in 1500, they believed they were “beyond the
    city of Cathay.”<a href="#_ednref3" name="_edn3" title="">[3]</a> The Italian
    explorer Giovanni da Verrazano similarly stated in the 1520s during his
    voyages to North America that his intention was “to reach Cathay and the
    extreme eastern coast of Asia.”<a href="#_ednref4" name="_edn4" title=""

    While many explorers like these expressed the desire to find Cathay in the
    Americas, Cathay also became a symbol of Asian wealth that was regularly
    folded into early descriptions of these new lands to the west of the Atlantic.
    For instance, describing Francisco Vázquez de Coronado’s expedition into what
    is today the American Southwest, Francisco López de Gómara recounted in his
    <em>Historia general de las Indias</em> that when the Coronado party reached
    Quivira, in what is today Kansas, “they saw on the coast ships which had
    pelicans of gold and silver on their prows, with merchandise that they thought
    to be from Cathay and China, because they made signs that they had sailed
    thirty days.”<a href="#_ednref5" name="_edn5" title="">[5]</a> Later in the
    century, when the English explorer Martin Frobisher returned from his search
    for a northwest passage in the 1570s, auditors investigating the financial
    failure of Frobisher's voyages described an Eskimo captive Frobisher brought
    back to England as a “strange man of Cathay." The Flemish painter Cornelis
    Ketel was commissioned to make portraits of the man (none of which have
    survived), and Frobisher claimed reimbursement for the "apparell for the
    strainge man of Cathay or new land India."<a
