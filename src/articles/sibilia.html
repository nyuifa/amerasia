<h1>Sibilia (Seville)</h1>

<p>
    In 1503, the crown of Castile established that
    <em>Casa de Contratación</em> (or <em>House of Trade</em>) in Seville to
    oversee its maritime empire. Its powers and responsibilities included
    financial and legal matters having to do with overseas trade (including the
    levying of taxes upon goods returning from the Americas to Spain), the
    movement of people around the Spanish global empire, the training of
    navigators, and the creation and maintenance of maps and charts. Mapmaking was
    an enormous undertaking at the <em>Casa</em>, which came to employ a sizable
    contingent of cartographers as Spain's overseas empire expanded. In particular
    where mapmaking was concerned, the <em>Casa</em> maintained a master map
    called the <em>Padrón Real</em> by extracting cartographic information from
    each ship as it returned from overseas and integrating this information in
    Seville.

<p>
    As one example of the collection of this geographic information, the
    Portuguese cartographer Diogo Ribeiro worked on the official maps of the
    <em>Padrón Real</em>, including the 1527 edition of this map, for which he
    employed information from Magellan’s voyage around the world to delineate the
    coasts of Central and South America. On the one hand, Ribeiro’s map appears to
    show the vastness of the Pacific, suggesting the separation of Asia and
    America. On the other hand, however, if we look more closely, a chain of ships
    links the Americas to the Moluccas, implying a maritime relationship between
    the two, and the west coast of the North American continent is left unfinished
    and therefore in an unclear relationship to Asia. In this way, Diogo Ribeiro’s
    map embraced a form of cartographic imperialism that allowed the Spanish to
    consider the lands of Asia as part of their growing American empire: an idea
    that surely interested the <em>Casa de Contratacíon</em> in Seville. To put it
    another way, even maps like Ribeiro’s&#8212maps that showed an expanding
    Pacific--could still embrace Amerasian thinking.
