<h1>India Extra Gangem</h1>

<p>
    As Vittoria Riccio’s essay on the words <em>India</em> and
    <em>Indiano</em> makes clear (LINK TO RICCIO ESSAY), these terms have a long
    history of flexibility, both spatially and ethnically. Indeed, on the Vopel
    map, variants of the toponym India show up in Africa, eastern Asia, and on
    Vopel’s Amerasian continent. In effect, India was everywhere.
</p>
<p>
    The development of the Amerasian idea relied to a large degree on India’s
    multi-partite geography. In this top right section of his map, for instance,
    Vopel indicates the regions of
    <em>India alta, India maior, India intra gangem,</em> and
    <em>India extra gangem</em>. For Hellenistic and Roman geographers, including
    Pliny, Strabo, Solinus, and Alexandrian astronomer and geographer Claudius
    Ptolemy, India was divided by the Ganges into two regions:
    <em>India intra gangem</em>, comprised of lands between the Indus and the
    Ganges, and <em>India extra gangem</em>, or India beyond the Ganges to the
    East—effectively, today, Southeast Asia--from the Ganges river to China
    (<em>Sinnae</em>), including modern Indochina, Indonesia, and countries on the
    maritime coast between India and China.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"

    These lands were indicated on Ptolemy’s 11th map of Asia. According to the
    fifteenth-century Venetian traveler Niccolò Conti, “All India is divided into
    three parts: one, extending from Persia to the Indus; the second, comprising
    the district from the Indus to the Ganges; and the third, all that is
    beyond.”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a> Vopel added a fourth, Greater
    India of Ethiopia, India Maior Ethiopiae, in eastern Africa just north of the
    Equator.

    The accounts of a variety of medieval writers, including 13th and 14th century
    merchants and missionaries such as those of Conti, Oderico da Pordenone, Marco
    Polo, and John Mandeville, all worked to develop a rich portrait of the entire
    Indian range.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a> In these depictions,
    India was a vast, populous, urbanized and civilized region filled with
    seemingly endless marvels, luxury goods, and extraordinary and monstrous
    peoples. It was famously visited by Thomas the Apostle (link to Thomas essay),
    who evangelized a portion of India shortly after the resurrection of Christ,
    was later inhabited, according to some accounts, by the legendary priest-king
    Prester John (link to Prester John essay) (link to GOCH entry) and his
    Christian kingdom, and was the physical location of the earthly paradise.
    India’s alterity and otherworldliness were inherently linked to its
    geographical extremity and liminality; it was a land that embodied both edge
    and origin.
</p>
<p>
    <em>India extra gangem</em> represented lands generally beyond the frontier of
    ancient knowledge and about which geographers and travelers knew very little.
    In Conti’s opinion, this part of India “excels the others in riches,
    politeness, and magnificence,” and was home to sumptuous buildings, rich
    merchants, and inhabitants leading “a refined life, removed from all barbarity
    and coarseness.”<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a> Pre-modern Europeans
    understood India beyond the Ganges as an ambiguous and flexible place; Ptolemy
    himself, for instance, left the exact location of the Golden Chersonese
    unclear. This allowed <em>India beyond the Ganges</em> to become a region
    where “travelers, geographers, cartographers, and audiences engage in an
    endless process of reinventing [it] in accordance with their own or their
    culture’s changing knowledge, needs, fears, and desires.”<a

    Most importantly where Vopel’s map is concerned, the remoteness and
    inaccessibility of these remote Indian lands allowed early modern geographers
    and cosmographers to understand <em>India extra gangem</em> as the location of
    the Americas; these both exotic and lesser-known lands could be adapted to
    encompass the Columbian voyages, which is why we see the toponym
    <em>India Orientalis</em> just west of Mexico on Vopel’s map. The concept of a
    multi-partite India functioned like a geographical accordion that could easily
    expand to incorporate newly discovered territories. It was for this reason
    that Columbus described the inhabitants of the lands where he landed in the
    western Atlantic the Indies (<em>las Indias</em>), and its inhabitants as
    Indians (<em>Indios</em>), language that would prove of enormous consequence
    in establishing an Amerasian understanding of where Columbus had gone. The
    numerous Latin versions of his Letter to Santángel published in the late
    fifteenth century, for instance, were almost all entitled "Letter of Columbus,
    on the Islands of India Beyond the Ganges Recently Discovered.” Richard Eden’s
    1553 translation of the works of Columbus and Vespucci, the first printed
    English text to consider these voyages, was entitled
    <em>A Treatyse of the Newe India</em>. Indeed, generations of writers,
    including historians, cosmographers, and missionaries, continued to refer to
    the lands across the Atlantic as Indies, well into the eighteenth century. The
    historian Nancy van Deusen has demonstrated how “the use of the descriptor
    <em>indio</em> in Castile referred to people from the East and West Indies,
    China, the Moluccas, India, Brazil, Hispaniola, Mexico, and Peru.” The
    flexibility of the term achieved its maximum extension during the course of
    the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6"
