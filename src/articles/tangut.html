<h1>Tangut</h1>

<p>
    The Western Xia or the kingdom of Xi Xia was also known to the Mongols as the
    Tangut Empire (as well as the Tangut people, an ethnicity), an empire in
    northwestern China in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Marco Polo dedicated
    much attention to the province of Tangut; the cities of Etzina and Sinja, and
    the province of Su-Chau, all described by Polo, are located on the Vopel Map
    to north and east of the toponym Tangut (<em>Ezina, Gingui, and Suchur</em>).
    In Etzina, “The inhabitants are idolaters and they take pleasure in the camels
    and the untamed wild asses” (<em
>Incolae idolatrae came/lis et onagris syluestri/bus gaudent</em
>). In Sinja, he says that “The inhabitants worship idols. Having an abundance
    of silk, they make elegant cloths from the barks of trees” (<em
>Incolae Idola colunt. serici copiam/ habentes, faciuntque pannos elegan/tes
    de arborum corticibus</em
>). In Su-Chau, Vopel says, “The inhabitants are in part Christian and in part
    idolatrous, subject to the Great Khan, and they have both cities and towns”
    (<em
>Incolae partim Christiani partim/ Idolatrae, subiecti magno Cham/ ciuitates
    et oppida habentes</em
>). Further north and east, Vopel also includes the Kingdom of Goch, also in
    Tangut (link to Goch entry).

    Tangut was a toponym present on many Amerasian maps (link to Wu essay). Vopel
    asserts “here the best musk is found” (<em>Hic muschum optimum/ inuenitur</em
>), repeating Polo’s claim that “this country produces the best and finest
    musk in the world,” and alluding once again to the Asian riches that could be
    reached in the exploration of the Americas.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"

>
    (Vopel also discusses the musk of beavers in his cartouche about Calicut, on
    the right edge of the map, in the Indian Ocean.) The Tangut Empire occupied a
    stretch of the Silk Road, and its wealth clearly attracted Vopel’s attention,
    as we can see by the copious number of cities and their wares from this part
    of China, such as silk and camels, that Vopel decided to include and describe
    on his map. Describing the city of Kalachan—not included on Vopel’s map, but
    noted by Polo in the province of Tangut—Polo states for instance that “in this
    city the finest camlets in the world are made of camel hair.”<a

    Camlet was a luxurious fabric traditionally made from a combination of silk
    and camel hair. After hearing Fra Marcos de Niza’s description of his 1539
    expedition along the upper Rio Grande in what is today New Mexico, Rodrigo de
    Albornoz, the treasurer of New Spain, wrote a summary of de Niza’s journey for
    the royal treasurer in Spain on 18 October 1539 reporting that de Niza had
    visited a land populated by camels, elephants, and people wearing camlet. It
    is likely that Albornoz was seeing Tangut in de Niza’s description of these
    regions north and west of Mexico.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a>
</p>
<p>
    East of Tangut on Vopel’s map is Tamacho. Here, Vopel tells us “Once called
    Tanguth, here they make precious garments and fine linen” (<em
>Olim Tanguth dicta, faciunt/ hic pannos praeciosos adque [sic]/
    sindones</em
>.) Vopel derived this idea—that Tamacho (a Mexican toponym) was once called
    Tangut—from the work of the Belgian cartographer Franciscus Monachus, who
    claimed in his De orbis situ (Antwerp, 1527) that “North of Culvacania spreads
    Thamacho, formerly called Tangut.”<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a>
    (There are several instances in Vopel’s map of a clear reliance on Monachus;
    see, for example the cartouche: America connected to the eastern lands [link
    to cartouche]. For Monachus and after him Vopel and Vavassore, China and
    Mexico overlapped, both temporally and spatially.
