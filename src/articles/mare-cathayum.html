<h1>Mare Cathayum</h1>

<p>
    According to Vopel’s Amerasian vision, what is today the Gulf of Mexico is
    labeled on his map as the Sea of Cathay. Various other maps used the same name
    for this body of water, including the Nancy Globe (1535), as did Bernard Van
    den Putte’s copy of Vopel’s map (Antwerp, 1570).
