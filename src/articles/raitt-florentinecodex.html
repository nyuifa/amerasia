<h1>Another Indianness: Re-Imagining the Diversity of Figuration in the Florentine Codex</h1>
<h2>Louisa M. Raitt</h2>
<p>The Florentine Codex, named for the Laurentian Library of Florence in which it is housed, is formally titled<i> The
    General History of the Things of New Spain, </i>and is divided into twelve sections.<a href="#raitt_edn1"
                                                                                           name="raitt_ednref1"
                                                                                           title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a>
    Each of these narratives delves deeply into the description of the native lands, histories, and cultures of the
    Aztec civilization as encountered by the Spanish during the first decades of contact. A Spanish Franciscan, Fray
    Bernardino de Sahagún (1499-1590) is credited with the compilation of the <i>Codex. </i>Sahagún travelled to central
    Mexico in 1529, just eight years after Cortés’ conquest of the Aztec Empire. He was primarily devoted to his
    missionary task,learning the local language of Nahuatl so that he could translate the psalms and the gospels into
    the native tongue. However, his most notable accomplishment was assembling the encyclopedic Florentine Codex, which
    documented the ‘New World’ from an indigenous worldview. The text, however, cannot merely be considered a work of
    Sahagún alone; for it is truly a verbal and visual construction of the Amerindian based on direct contribution from
    the Nahua people, marking an important collaboration between native and European populations in the New
    World.<a href="#raitt_edn2"

             title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
<p>The books of the codex are comprised of bilingual text, transliterated Nahuatl with an accompanying Spanish
    translation, and a set of complex and vividly colored images. The execution of such a complicated object depended on
    the Nahua <i>tlacuilos </i>who, as both scribes and painters, were trained as Sahagún’s students at the Colegio de
    Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco in the European style.<a href="#raitt_edn3"
                                                      name="raitt_ednref3"
                                                      title=""><sup>[3]</sup></a> At times, the Spanish translation of
    the original Nahuatl text offers not only a simple translation but also a contemporary interpretation,
    contextualizing and cushioning the unfamiliar information for a European readership. The images, too, present a
    fusion of cultures. Serge Gruzinski called it an “unprecedented experiment,” wherein the “Renaissance arts of
    sculpture, architecture and painting entered into a dialogue with traditions that had been cultivated by
    pre-Columbian civilizations for millennia.”<a href="#raitt_edn4"
                                                  name="raitt_ednref4"
                                                  title=""><sup>[4]</sup></a> In its collaborative nature, <i>The
        Florentine Codex</i> includes the indigenous perspective directly in the image-making, image-explaining, and
    image-viewing process during the age of encounter between Europe and the Indies.  How was this fascinating
    encyclopedic text received? How did its images settle into existing conceptualizations of the Indies and
    furthermore, how can these images be read as models of Amerasian imaginary?</p>
<p>The Nahua <i>tlacuilos</i> took great care to depict themselves in a way that retained the authenticity of their
    cultural traditions so that their culture could be preserved; at the same time, their work embodies and employs
    traditions of the Renaissance avant-garde so their culture may be seen and understood as a valuable contributor in a
    larger artistic discourse. The <i>tlacuilos</i> were active creators, Europeanizing their way of seeing while
    remaining faithful to ancient canons.<a href="#raitt_edn5"

                                            title=""><sup>[5]</sup></a> The <i>Codex </i>may be read as a project of
    self-representation, using dress and costume to determine visual indicators of class, rank, and profession and also
    to distinguish gods from mortals from <i>ixiptla </i>(incarnated images).<a

              name="raitt_ednref7"
              title=""><sup>[7]</sup></a> However, the reception of their efforts extended far beyond their control.
    Through their individualistic and highly stylized figurations, the Nahua <i>tlacuilos</i> complicated and thus
    enabled existing European approaches to understanding the Indies, playing into visual models for both America and
    Asia. (On the range of meanings of the word India and Indians,

<p>In April of 1577, before the <i>Codex </i>had been completed, Philip II of Spain (1527-1598) mandated that Sahagún
    stop all book production considering the works to be blasphemous in nature and ordered that the<i> Codex </i>be sent
    to himin Madrid.<a

                                          title=""><sup>[9]</sup></a> However, by 1580, the <i>Codex</i> had arrived in
    the collection of the Medici family in Italy.<a href="#raitt_edn10"
                                                    name="raitt_ednref10"
                                                    title=""><sup>[10]</sup></a> As Lia Markey has proposed, the <i>Codex</i>
    was likely gifted by Philip II to Ferdinando I de' Medici (1549-1609) while he was a cardinal in Rome. As guardian
    of the Franciscan friars, and as a man with a personal fascination for colonial objects, he seemed to be the ideal
    candidate to guard the book.<a
            href="#raitt_edn11"
            name="raitt_ednref11"
            title=""><sup>[11]</sup></a> When Ferdinando was appointed Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1587 and moved to
    Florence, he took his precious <i>Codex </i>with him. The <i>Codex</i> clearly captivated Ferdinando’s attention
    and, as Markey’s research has shown, greatly influenced the decoration of his <i>Armeria</i> by Ludovico Buti in the
    Galleria degli Uffizi.<a href="#raitt_edn12"
                             name="raitt_ednref12"

<p>            During this age of expansion, objects, documents, and accounts of exploration “exposed Europe to even
    more distant peoples in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, which broke the boundaries of what Europeans knew about the
    world.”<a href="#raitt_edn13"
              name="raitt_ednref13"
              title=""><sup>[13]</sup></a> To Philip II and Ferdinando de Medici this book would have represented yet
    another souvenir or curiosity from that world, the new world, the Indies that seemed to be ever expanding. While
    they understood that the <i>Codex</i> boasted images of the Indians from the territory recently conquered by Cortés
    and made available to the missionary work of the Mendicant orders, they were unable to comprehend with exactitude
    where the book fit into the larger picture of world cultures. In simple terms, the Codex offered its readers an
    abundance of information about this complex civilization and its images, while leaving open the question of its
    relation to the larger Indian extension.</p>
<p>            The codex emphasizes variations of costume, skin color, and individuality as primary markers of
    difference, a point made clearly by two groupings of figures: the portraits of the Aztec deities of book one and the
    artists’ portraits of book nine.<a href="#raitt_edn14"
                                       name="raitt_ednref14"
                                       title=""><sup>[14]</sup></a> These two sets of figures assimilate the Aztec into
    the category of the exotic, allowing for the conflation of the Amerindian with other Indians from other distant
    places.
</p>
<p>            Book one employs a sequence of full-page illustrations of the personifications of the Aztec gods (Fig.
    1). Each page is divided into two registers and further subdivided making equal rectangular frames to house four
    different Aztec gods per page. The gods vary in size, orientation, and manifest slight variations in posture;
    however most are shown in profile holding a scepter in one hand and a shield or other militaristic or ceremonial
    device in the other. The most striking differences are in the vestments worn by each deity: some don full feathered
    capes, others simple, short, skirts, while others still are mostly clothed with long tunics over long skirts. They
    also possess a wide variety of headgear, some bearing feather headdresses, others ornate crowns, and some no
    headwear at all. The skin tones of the gods, too, run a wide spectrum, from dark black figures to others with skin
    colored bright red or yellow in hue, and even to skin more white than the background of the page. While possibly
    representative of the intentions of the Nahua to represent the heterogeneity and preserve the cultural variations of
    the Aztec people, this array of skin tones certainly would have registered as an “ethnographic map” or chart of
    diversity for a European audience that served to categorize the people who inhabited the Indies by their different
    types rather than act as portraits of nuanced variety within a single civilization.<a
            href="#raitt_edn15"
            name="raitt_ednref15"
            title=""><sup>[15]</sup></a>  While race was not a formal social construct in the sixteenth century, many
    proto-ethnographic accounts from the far reaches of the world written during this period took special note of skin
    color, catering to an audience keenly attuned to nuances in pigment and physiognomy.<a
            href="#raitt_edn16"
            name="raitt_ednref16"
            title=""><sup>[16]</sup></a> Seeing these diverse exotic figures occupying the same pages of a single book
    would have suggested that they inhabited a part of the world with a diversity of climates and cultures, reinforcing
    the idea of a vast Indian extension. </p>
<p>            The emphasis on diversity, with its suggestion of significant geographic range, stands in contrast to the
    flattened portrayal of the Amerindian in the illustrations of the <i>Trachtenbuc</i>h of Christoph Weiditz from some
    decades earlier (Fig. 3). The <i>Trachtenbuch </i>contained not only full page illustrations of European traditional
    costume but also included portraits of natives brought back to Spain in 1528 by Hernando Cortés to join the court of
    Charles V. Drawing our attention to the thirteen paintings of Amerindians in the <i>Trachtenbuch, </i>Elizabeth
    Boone points out that it was difficult “for Europeans then—and even for scholars until recently—to recognize real
    ethnic, cultural, and, indeed, social distinctions among the indigenous people of the Americas.” By contrast, “how
    easy it was simply to blend them together as exotics.”<a href="#raitt_edn17"
                                                             name="raitt_ednref17"
                                                             title=""><sup>[17]</sup></a> The understanding of the
    Indies, as revealed by the glosses of the <i>Trachtenbuch</i>, is simply a land far away, with gold in the water,
    the land of the Indians. Therefore, the intent of the Nahua artists to showcase the Aztec as a multivalent people
    comprised of many heterogeneous cultures is lost on the receiving European audience, and what sticks is the vibrancy
    and exoticism that validate a European perception of Indianness.</p>
<p>            The representation of clothing, and its absence, plays another important role for the European imaginary.
    The conquest of the Aztec was often portrayed as armored Spanish soldiers dominating a population of naked, or
    nearly naked, barbarous figures. A sixteenth-century painting by the Dutch artist Jan Mostaert (Fig. 4), for
    example, is described by Karel Van Mander as “a landscape, a West Indian one, with many naked
    people.”<a href="#raitt_edn18"
               name="raitt_ednref18"
               title=""><sup>[18]</sup></a> Their nakedness, along with their basic technology and contrasting skin tone
    were meant to register both a geospatial and temporal distance. And yet, this is not how other types of Indians are
    portrayed. Images of other civilizations that made up the Indies, what we would call Asia for example, did not often
    warrant naked or near-naked depictions.<a
            href="#raitt_edn19"
            name="raitt_ednref19"
            title=""><sup>[19]</sup></a> In fact, when members of Ferdinando de Medici’s court saw Jacopo Zucchi’s <i>Allegory
        of the Americas </i>(Fig. 5), they understood the figures in the foreground to be “beautiful Roman woman” that
    were disguised as “New World Natives.”<a href="#raitt_edn20"
                                             name="raitt_ednref20"
                                             title=""><sup>[20]</sup></a> Perhaps his remarks indicate that nudity had
    come to be synonymous with America; whereas complex codified difference based on diverse clothing signaled something
    else entirely. </p>
<p>            A related trope, the allegories of the continents, popularized during the sixteenth and seventeenth
    centuries reveals a similar tension between nude and clothed figures. America (along with Africa) is nearly always
    personified as a naked figure, adorned with beautiful jewels but left unclothed and vulnerable. Asia on the other
    hand, much like Europe, is dressed in fine garments; while still very foreign and exotic to the European eye, the
    personification of Asia is seen as dignified merely by its clothed association with Europe.<a href="#raitt_edn21"
                                                                                                  name="raitt_ednref21"
                                                                                                  title=""><sup>[21]</sup></a>
    A sixteenth century engraved series personifying the continents by Adriaen Collaert (Fig. 7) portrays America as a
    woman, scantily clad with a swatch of drapery gently covering her lap, leaving her torso entirely exposed. Her curly
    hair is tucked under a feather-plumed headdress and she grasps a bow and arrow. Alternatively, his personification
    for Asia wears sandals and a complicated costume, resembling the armored dress robes of militant saint or angel in
    the Christian tradition. She swings an incense burner and dons a headdress, which billows in the wind behind her.
    Furthermore, even if her eyes do not meet ours Asia is facing forward toward the viewer, offering another point of
    similitude with the engraved Europa; America on the other hand, looks back behind her shoulder into the distance
    beyond, where the Amerindians are suffering loss in battle against the invading European forces. These examples
    together reinforce the imagery that was created by Marco Polo’s opulent descriptions from his journey to the
    wondrous and civilized Cathay, the land of the Great Khan.<a href="#raitt_edn22"
                                                                 name="raitt_ednref22"
                                                                 title=""><sup>[22]</sup></a> This imagery persisted in
    the mindset of other European explorers and the association of Asia as a land of a prosperous ancient civilization,
    not a barbarous and savage unknown, endured for centuries. Even Francis Xavier, upon his arrival to Japan in the mid
    sixteenth century, remarked that the inhabitants were pale skinned, like Europeans and that it must be because Japan
    shares the same latitude as Italy, for “the climate of Japan resembles that of Italy, and the natives are <sup>[also]</sup>
    much like the Italians in height.”<a href="#raitt_edn23"
                                         name="raitt_ednref23"
                                         title=""><sup>[23]</sup></a> Since the time of Marco Polo, Europeans saw
    civility and wealth in the lands to the east, the lands of Asia; perhaps then we can image that the sheer presence
    and wide array of intricate garments depicted on the pages of the <i>Florentine Codex</i> thus registered the
    Indians therein as part of an equally sophisticated, if not the same fascinating civilization. </p>
<p>            A similar argument can be woven through a discussion of the artist portraits in book nine which offer
    a<i> </i>heightened degree of detail, attention to individual difference, and the careful representation of the
    sophisticated visual culture of the Nahua artists. The pages, through both text and image, display various crafts
    including charcoal and clay work, glue making, gold making, lapidary, and feather making. The portraits of the
    artists serve several functions within the book. Firstly, they reflect the artists’ incorporation of stylistic
    qualities learned through their training in the newly established Franciscan schools. The painter is attentive to
    situate the <i>amantecas</i>, or featherworkers for example, in a typical Renaissance architectural setting
    incorporating doorways flanked by columns, corbelled archways, receding tile floors, background landscapes, and even
    adjusting the positioning of the figures all to reveal the use of linear perspective, a technique not used prior to
    Spanish conquest. The painters clearly used the codex as an opportunity to flaunt their quick mastery of European
    techniques but in a way that translates their traditional artistic practices into a visually legible format for
    European audiences.</p>
<p>Secondly, each vignette is used to highlight individuality and difference. For example, in each vignette, the
    architectural details change and no two settings are the same. The individuality and diversity of wardrobe and skin
    color emphasized in book one, previously discussed, extends her to physical difference on an individual level. As
    seen in a detail from Magaloni Kerpel’s book <i>The Colors of the New World</i>,<a href="#raitt_edn24"
                                                                                       name="raitt_ednref24"
                                                                                       title=""><sup>[24]</sup></a> the
    Nahua painted the artists as careful portraits; no two faces are the same. These portraits thus represent both the
    desire of the Nahua to display their own individuality and diversity in a mode of visuality that would register with
    their European readership.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>            </b>And yet, the clothing system used in these artist portraits distances them from the stereotypical
    Amerindian imagery. While the <i>amantecas </i>work on feather crafts, they wear draped grey tunics and resemble
    portraits of medieval clerical artists more closely than the Amerindians from the <i>Trachtenbuch. </i>These
    garments would be familiar to a late sixteenth century European eye; and yet, when applied to these artist figures
    and cast into an Amerindian world, the viewer is asked to consider the civility and sophistication of the
    civilization from which these Indians and their objects hail. If they dress like us, and look like us, then they too
    could be like the natives of the lands to the East, the sophisticated and wealthy Indies where the gold runs in the
    water and where the Great Kahn made his home.</p>
<p><i>            </i>The heightened attention to individuality and difference, the contextualization in Renaissance
    settings, the application of European artistic techniques, and the portrayal of these artists in professional
    systematized costume troubled the understanding of the Amerindian and detached the Nahua from any particular place
    and time. Instead, these images left room for the European viewer to envisage these figures occupying a multitude of
    different lands, many of which they had conflated or overlapped in their working imaginary of the Indies. Ferdinando
    de Medici acquired the book not because it offered insight into a particular history of a particular civilization
    but rather because he saw it as “a valuable ‘rarity’, adding this work of art to his own <sup>[growing]</sup>
    collection of <sup>[other]</sup> exotica in Florence.”<a
            href="#raitt_edn25"
            name="raitt_ednref25"
            title=""><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>
<p>            Perhaps the diverse array of figures displayed in the <i>Florentine Codex</i> represented a sort of alpha
    and omega,<a href="#raitt_edn26"
                 name="raitt_ednref26"
                 title=""><sup>[26]</sup></a> a “zone of convergence where East and West met and crossed over into one
    another,”<a href="#raitt_edn27"
                name="raitt_ednref27"
                title=""><sup>[27]</sup></a> Furthermore, it signified an ambiguous place where the barbarous new world
    filled of luxurious gems, feathers, gold and silver, and nude savage figures fell into and mixed with the opulent
    known richness of the east, the luxury goods - the gold, the porcelain, and the silks – that had already come to
    European courts from the East. </p>
<p>            This ambiguity can be seen on Caspar Vopel’s map printed by Vavassore in 1588 which details a multitude
    of sites from the Mexican valley amidst known Asian locales. ‘Temixtitan’ (another spelling of Tenochtitlan) appears
    in capital letters, just to the south of the cartographic sign for the city, a castle with four spires cast out in
    the middle of a lake.<a
            href="#raitt_edn28"
            name="raitt_ednref28"
            title=""><sup>[28]</sup></a> The Nahua specifically are included by Vopel, situated within this cartographic
    environ, just above and to the northeast of the Temixtitan label, as indicated by the pin of this entry.
    Additionally, nearby, ‘Atacuba’ (Tacuba) marks the site of the pre-Hispanic Nahua city of Tlacopan, meaning place of
    the jarilla plant. Just to the northwest of ‘Nautal’ on the map is ‘Leztalap’ which could be a poor transliteration
    of the Ancient Aztec city of Iztapalapa. Further north lies the city of ‘Gualncingo’ (Tulancingo), the place from
    which Prince Ixtlilxochitl gathered an army here to join Hernán Cortés to conquer Tenochtitlan in 1521. However,
    what complicates this further is that these places of the valley of Mexico are just northwest of Tampin, a city in
    Malaysia that lies on the border of Malacca and just south of Singur, a known city on the Indian subcontinent. As a
    result, the location of the site of production of the Florentine Codex as noted in the Vopel map represents the
    physical conflation or confusion of East and West which some viewers would have projected onto the visual imagery of
    its pages.  </p>
<p>            In these ways, the Florentine Codex was an open text, capable of being mobilized into a worldview that
    was itself under development. Its open-ended reception is made evident by the partial copy of <i>The</i> <i>Florentine
        Codex </i>that has recently been discovered at the Hispanic Society of America in New York, with the text

    This copy, likely made in the 1580s, “lacks images,” but “has spaces intended for images… <sup>[which]</sup>
    correspond precisely to the location of the images in the <i>Florentine Codex</i>.”<a href="#raitt_edn30"
                                                                                          name="raitt_ednref30"
                                                                                          title=""><sup>[30]</sup></a>
    It proves Ferdinando’s contemporary fascination with the <i>Codex</i> and also captivates our imagination now. Could
    we have better understood the way in which the <i>Codex </i>was received if Ferdinando’s artists had finished their
    version, translating not only the text but the images as well? What would these new world images have become in the
    hands of European artists? And more precisely, what version of Indianness would have inhabited their imagined world?

          title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a> I find it important to situate this collaboration within the broader context of
        Iberian conquest practices. For the Spanish, conquest did not necessitate complete erasure. The Reconquest of
        the Iberian Peninsula, which had ended the same year that Columbus set sail to find a western sea route to
        travel eastward, prompted a posture of building upon and constructing with the native population in the
        territories found across the Atlantic. The mindset of the Reconquista had persisted in the mentality of the
        Catholic Kingdoms for centuries before the unification of Spain under a single crown in 1492. Thus, when the
        Spanish, under Cortés, arrived in Veracruz and encountered the Aztec it should <i>not</i> be surprising that the
        Spanish invited the local artistic population to work alongside their conquerors to create new cultural
        products.</p>

        that is a bit misleading.
    Aztec is a name for a civilization in Central Mexico, that was comprised of
    multiple cultural groups. The&nbsp;Mexica people were at the heart of the
    empire, but the Nahua people, for example had
    been a center of power since around 600 BCE and their control expanded into
    areas earlier occupied by Totonacan and Huastec peoples. At its height, the Aztec empire expanded from the Pacific
    Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico, from Central Mexico all the way to what is present
    day Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. The empire must be imagined more as an
    alliance of city-states, each boasting its own autonomous control but allied
    with surrounding powers.</p>
