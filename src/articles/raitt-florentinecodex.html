  Another Indianness: Re-Imagining the Diversity of Figuration in the Florentine
  Codex

  The Florentine Codex, formally titled
  <i>The General History of the Things of New Spain</i> and named for the
  Laurentian Library of Florence in which it is housed, describes the lands,
  histories, and cultures of Aztec civilization.<a

  The Spanish Franciscan Fray Bernardino de Sahagún (1499-1590) is credited with
  its compilation. Sahagún travelled to central Mexico in 1529, just eight years
  after Cortés' conquest of Tenochtitlan. As a missionary, he learned Nahuatl,
  enabling him to translate the psalms and the gospels for local populations.
  Sahagún's most notable accomplishment, however, was his assembling of this
  encyclopedic codex. However, the codex cannot be merely considered a work of
  Sahagún alone, for it was truly a verbal and visual documentation of Mexican
  civilization from an indigenous point of view. The text represents a
  monumental collaboration between indigenous and European populations in the
  first decades of contact between Europeans and Amerindians.<a

<p>
  The books of the codex are comprised of bilingual text, transliterated Nahuatl
  with side-by-side Spanish translation, accompanied by a series of complex and
  vividly colored images. The creation of such a complicated object depended on
  the Nahua <i>tlacuilos,</i> or scribe/painters, who were trained as Sahagún's
  students in the European style at the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco.<a
    href="#_edn3"

    >[3]</a
  >
  At times, the text offers not only translation but also contemporary
  interpretations of Aztec life, especially in moments when it contextualizes
  unfamiliar information for a European readership. The images, too, present a
  fusion of cultures. The Nahua <i>tlacuilos</i> who worked with Sahagún took
  great care to depict themselves in a way that retained the authenticity of
  their cultural traditions so that their culture could be preserved; at the
  same time, they depicted their culture in a European style in order to make it
  accessible and interesting to European audiences. In this way, the
  <i>tlacuilos</i> were active creators, Europeanizing their way of seeing while
  remaining faithful to ancient canons.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""
    >[4]</a
  >
  Serge Gruzinski called it an "unprecedented experiment," wherein the
  "Renaissance arts of sculpture, architecture and painting entered into a
  dialogue with traditions that had been cultivated by pre-Columbian
  civilizations for millennia."<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a>
  How was this fascinating encyclopedic text received? How did its images settle
  into existing conceptualizations of the Indies and furthermore, how can these
  images be read as evidence of an Amerasian imaginary?
</p>
<p>
  Philip II of Spain (1527-1598) believed that Sahagún's work was blasphemous.
  He mandated that Sahagún stop the book's production and in April of 1577,
  before the codex had been completed, ordered it to be sent to Madrid.<a
    href="#_edn6"
    name="_ednref6"
    title=""
    >[6]</a
  >
  Despite the monarch's disapproval, it was likely used there almost immediately
  to teach Spanish missionaries about the Nahua people and their customs.<a
    href="#_edn7"
    name="_ednref7"
    title=""
    >[7]</a
  >
  By 1580, the codex had arrived in the collection of the Medici family in
  Italy.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a> As Lia Markey has
  proposed, Philip II likely gifted the codex to Ferdinando I de' Medici
  (1549-1609) while he was a cardinal in Rome. As a <i>custos</i>, or superior,
  of the Franciscans, and as a man with a personal fascination for colonial
  objects, Ferdinando seemed to be the ideal candidate to guard the book.<a
    href="#_edn9"
    name="_ednref9"
    title=""
    >[9]</a
  >
  When Ferdinando was appointed Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1587 and moved to
  Florence, he took the precious codex with him; it had clearly captured his
  attention and, as Markey's research has shown, greatly influenced the
  decoration of his <i>Armeria</i> by Ludovico Buti in the
  <i>Galleria degli Uffizi</i>.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""
    >[10]</a
  >(On the Buti frescoes, see the essay by
  <a href="#weitzman-armeria">Margo Weitzman.</a>)
</p>
<p>
  During this age of expansion, objects, documents, and accounts of exploration
  "exposed Europe to even more distant peoples in Asia, Africa, and the
  Americas, which broke the boundaries of what Europeans knew about the
  world."<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a> To Philip II and
  Ferdinando de Medici, this book would have represented yet another curiosity
  from the Indies. While they understood that the codex contained images of the
  Indians from the territory recently conquered by Cortés and in turn made
  available to mendicants, they were unable to comprehend how the book fit into
  a larger picture of world cultures. In simple terms, the codex offered its
  readers an abundance of information about this complex civilization and its
  images, while leaving open the question of what and where exactly the Indies
  were.
</p>
<p>
  The codex used a great variety of representations of dress and costume to
  visualize Aztec conceptions of class, rank, and profession, as well as to
  distinguish between gods, mortals, and <i>ixiptla</i> (incarnated images).<a
    href="#_edn12"
    name="_ednref12"
    title=""
    >[12]</a
  >
  Mapping such differences allowed indigenous artists to showcase the
  heterogeneity of the Aztec people.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""
    >[13]</a
  >
  While the European reception of these images was always beyond their control,
  as we shall see, these stylized figures perhaps inadvertently encouraged
  Europeans to understand the Indies as lands where America and Asia overlapped.
  (On the range of meanings of the word India and Indians, see the entry by
  <a href="#riccio-india">Vittoria Riccio</a>.) The codex emphasizes
  variations in things like costume and skin color as markers of difference, a
  point made clearly by two groupings of figures in particular: the portraits of
  the Aztec deities in book one and the artists' portraits in book nine. These
  two sets of figures assimilate the Aztec into the category of the exotic,
  setting up the possibility for their conflation with other Indians from other
  distant places.
</p>
<p>
  Book one employs a sequence of full-page illustrations of the personifications
  of the Aztec gods (Fig. 1).

</p>
<p>
  Each page is divided into two registers and further subdivided, making equal
  rectangular frames to house four different Aztec gods per page. The gods vary
  in size, orientation, and manifest slight variations in posture; however most
  are shown in profile holding a scepter in one hand and a shield or other
  militaristic or ceremonial device in the other. The most striking differences
  are in the vestments worn by each deity; some don full feathered capes, others
  simple, short, skirts, while others still are mostly clothed with long tunics
  over long skirts. They also possess a wide variety of headgear, some bearing
  feather headdresses, others ornate crowns, and some no headwear at all. The
  skin tones of the gods, too, run a wide spectrum, from dark black figures to
  others with skin colored bright red or yellow in hue. Some have skin that is
  whiter than the background of the page. While the Nahua may have hoped to use
  these images to represent and preserve the complexity of Aztec culture, this
  array of skin tones would have likely registered as an "ethnographic map" for
  a European audience, a map that worked to categorize the people of the Indies
  by different types rather than to underscore the nuanced variety of this
  civilization.<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a> While race
  was not an established social construct in the sixteenth century, many
  proto-ethnographic accounts from the far reaches of the world written during
  this period took special note of skin color, catering to an audience keenly
  attuned to nuances in pigment and physiognomy.<a

  Seeing these diverse exotic figures in the pages of the codex could easily
  have suggested to European readers that these people inhabited a part of the
  world with a diversity of climates and cultures: the Indies, or as an
  extension of India.
</p>
<p>
  The codex's emphasis on diversity and its suggestion of the significant
  geographic range of Aztec peoples stands in stark contrast to the flattened
  portrayal of the Amerindian in the illustrations of the <i>Trachtenbuch</i> of
  Christoph Weiditz from some decades earlier (Fig. 2).

</p>
<p>
  The <i>Trachtenbuch</i> contained not only full page illustrations of European
  traditional costume but also included portraits of New World peoples brought
  back to Spain in 1528 by Hernán Cortés. Drawing our attention to the thirteen
  paintings of Amerindians in the <i>Trachtenbuch, </i>Elizabeth Boone points
  out that it was difficult "for Europeans then&#8212;and even for scholars
  until recently&#8212;to recognize real ethnic, cultural, and, indeed, social
  distinctions among the indigenous people of the Americas." By contrast, "how
  easy it was simply to blend them together as exotics."
  <a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[16]</a> As the glosses of the
  <i>Trachtenbuch</i> suggest, the Indies were simply distant lands. Therefore,
  the intent of Nahua artists to depict the Aztecs as a complex and
  heterogeneous culture was likely lost on European audiences; what stuck,
  perhaps, was more the vibrancy and exoticism that worked to confirm European
  perceptions of Indianness.
</p>
<p>
  The presence and absence of clothing also played an important role in
  Europeans' understanding of the Indians. European chroniclers typically
  portrayed the conquest of the Aztecs through scenes of armored Spanish
  soldiers defeating a population of naked or nearly naked indigenous figures.
  The art historian Karel Van Mander, for instance, describes such a scene
  painted by the Dutch artist Jan Mostaert as "a landscape, a West Indian one,
  with many naked people." (Fig. 3)

<p>
  Their nakedness, along with their primitive technology and contrasting skin
  tone were meant to register both a geospatial and temporal distance. And yet,
  this is not how other types of Indians are portrayed. Images of other
  civilizations that made up the Indies, what we would call Asia for example,
  did not often employ depictions of indigenous peoples as naked or
  near-naked.<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a> In fact, when
  members of Ferdinando de Medici's court saw Jacopo Zucchi's
  <i>Allegory of the Americas</i> (Fig. 4), they understood the figures in the
  foreground to be "beautiful Roman women" that were disguised as "New World
  Natives."<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[19]</a> Perhaps his
  remarks indicate that nudity had come to be synonymous with the Americas,
  while diverse clothing signaled something else entirely.<a

<p>
  A related trope, the allegories of the continents, which became increasingly
  popular in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, reveals a similar tension
  between nude and clothed figures. America (along with Africa) is nearly always
  personified as a naked figure, adorned with beautiful jewels but left
  unclothed and vulnerable. The personification of Asia, on the other hand, is
  dressed in fine garments; while still foreign and exotic, it was usually
  associated with Europe through clothing.<a

<p>
  A sixteenth century engraved series personifying the continents by Adriaen
  Collaert (Figs. 5-8) portrays America (Fig. 5) as a woman, scantily clad with
  a swatch of drapery gently covering her lap, leaving her torso entirely
  exposed. Her curly hair is tucked under a feather-plumed headdress and she
  grasps a bow and arrow. Alternatively, his personification of Asia (Fig. 6)
  wears sandals and a complicated costume, resembling the armored dress and
  robes of a militant saint or angel in the Christian tradition. She swings an
  incense burner and dons a headdress, which billows in the wind behind her.
  Furthermore, even if her eyes do not meet ours, Asia is facing forward toward
  the viewer, much like Europa (Fig. 7); America, on the other hand, looks back
  behind her shoulder into the distance beyond, where the Amerindians suffer
  losses in battle against invading European forces.
</p>
<p>
  European allegories of Asia reinforce Marco Polo's representations of Cathay,
  and of Asia as a prosperous ancient civilization. Even Francis Xavier, upon
  his arrival to Japan in the mid-sixteenth century, remarked that the
  inhabitants were pale skinned like Europeans; for Xavier, this must have been
  because Japan shares the same latitude as Italy, for "the climate of Japan
  resembles that of Italy, and the natives are [also] much like the Italians in
  height."<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[22]</a> Since the time of
  Marco Polo, Europeans saw civility and wealth in the Orient; knowing this, we
  can imagine that the wide array of intricate garments depicted on the pages of
  the Florentine Codex could have easily registered as Asian for learned
  European audiences.
</p>
<p>
  Details in the artist portraits in book nine have similar implications (Fig.
  9).

  Fig. 9: Fray Bernardino de Sahagœn and Nahua artists, The Art of the Amanteca
  (feather artists), the Florentine Codex, ca. 1555-1577. Florence, Biblioteca
  Medicea Laurenziana, Mediceo Palatino 219 Book IX, chapter 21, fol. 65v and
  66r.
</p>
<p>
  Here, both text and image represent the production of a variety of Aztec
  crafts, including work in charcoal, clay, glue, gold, gems, and feathers. The
  portraits of the artists serve several functions in the text. Firstly, they
  highlight the artists' embrace of European artistic techniques learned in
  their training in the newly established Franciscan schools. The painter is
  attentive to situate the <i>amantecas</i>, or Aztec featherworkers for
  example, in a typical Renaissance architectural setting, incorporating
  doorways flanked by columns, corbelled archways, receding tile floors,
  background landscapes, and even adjusting the positioning of the figures all
  to reveal the use of linear perspective, a technique not used prior to Spanish
  conquest. Indigenous artists clearly used the codex to flaunt their quick
  mastery of European techniques, but in a way that translated traditional
  artistic practices into a format legible to European audiences. Secondly, each
  vignette is different in its architectural details and setting. The diversity
  of wardrobe and skin color emphasized in book one extends here to a variety of
  physical differences among the individuals depicted. As Magaloni Kerpel has
  shown, the Nahua painted these artists as careful portraits; no two faces are
  the same.<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[23]</a> These portraits
  thus represent both the desire of the Nahua to display their individuality and
  diversity in a style that would resonate with European readers.
</p>
<p>
  And yet, this clothing is far from Amerindian. While the <i>amantecas</i> work
  on feather crafts, for instance, they wear draped grey tunics and resemble
  portraits of medieval clerical artists more than Amerindians from the
  <i>Trachtenbuch. </i>These garments would be familiar to a late
  sixteenth-century European eye; and yet, when worn by new world peoples, the
  viewer is asked to consider the sophistication of the civilization from which
  these Indians and their objects hail. If they dress like us, and look like
  us&#8212;or as allegorical images suggest, if they wear clothing, as did
  Europeans and Asians &#8212;then they too could be like the natives of the
  marvelous and sophisticated lands of the East.
</p>
<p>
  A heightened attention to individuality and difference, the contextualization
  of Aztec culture in Renaissance settings, the application of European artistic
  techniques, and the portrayal of these artists in professional European
  costume all worked to unsettle images of the Amerindian and detached the Nahua
  from any particular place and time. Instead, these images left room for the
  European viewer to envisage these figures occupying a multitude of different
  lands in the Indies. Indeed, Ferdinando de Medici acquired the codex not
  because it offered insight into a particular history of a particular
  civilization, but rather because he saw it as "a valuable 'rarity', adding
  this work of art to his own [growing] collection of [other] exotica in
  Florence."<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title="">[24]</a>
</p>
<p>
  Perhaps the diverse array of figures displayed in the Florentine Codex
  represented a kind of contact zone, or a "zone of convergence where East and
  West met and crossed over into one another."<a
    href="#_edn25"
    name="_ednref25"
    title=""
    >[25]</a
  >
  Furthermore, it signified an ambiguous place where the barbarous New World
  filled with luxurious gems, feathers, gold and silver, and nude savage figures
  fell into and mixed with the opulent known richness of the east, the luxury
  goods &#8211; the gold, the porcelain, and the silks &#8211; that had already
  come to European courts from the East. To be clear, much of this discussion
  remains speculative; we have no direct testimony on the part of Europeans
  declaring how, exactly, they understood the images in Sahagún's compilation,
  or to what other representations they may have likened them. Nevertheless,
  clearly, there was clearly potential for European readers to identify the
  figures in the codex as Indian, broadly cast, or as Asian.
</p>
<p>
  Vopel's map echoes this ambiguity. "Temixtitan" (another spelling of
  Tenochtitlan) appears in capital letters just to the south of the cartographic
  sign for the city, a castle with four spires cast out in the middle of a lake,
  and Vopel places the Nahua just to the northeast.<a
    href="#_edn26"
    name="_ednref26"
    title=""
    >[26]</a
  >
  Nearby "Atacuba" (Tacuba) marks the site of the pre-Hispanic Nahua city of
  Tlacopan, meaning "place of the jarilla plant". Just to the northwest of
  "Nautal" on the map is "Leztalap" which could be a poor transliteration of the
  Ancient Aztec city of Iztapalapa. Further north lies the city of 'Gualncingo'
  (Tulancingo), the place from which Prince Ixtlilxochitl gathered an army here
  to join Hernán Cortés to conquer Tenochtitlan in 1521. All of these places in
  the valley of Mexico are just northwest of Tampin, a city in Malaysia that
  lies on the border of Malacca and just south of Singur, a known city on the
  Indian subcontinent. In effect, Vopel's map suggests that the Florentine
  Codex, made in Tlatelolco, was produced in the lands where East and West
  overlapped.
</p>
<p>
  In these ways, the Florentine Codex was an open text, capable of being
  mobilized within a European worldview that was itself also under development.
  A later sixteenth-century edition of the Florentine Codex that has recently
  been discovered at the Hispanic Society of America in New York, with text
  translated into Italian and the cover bearing Cardinal Ferdinando's coat of
  arms, also highlights the codex's flexible, Amerasian nature.<a
    href="#_edn27"
    name="_ednref27"
    title=""
    >[27]</a
  >
  This copy, likely made in the 1580s, lacks images, but "has spaces intended
  for images... [which] correspond precisely to the location of the images in
  the Florentine Codex."<a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title="">[28]</a> It
  proves Ferdinando's contemporary fascination with the codex and continues to
  captivate our imagination now. Could we have better understood the way in
  which the codex was received if Ferdinando's artists had finished their
  version, copying and perhaps refashioning not only the text but the images as
  well? What would these new world images have become in the hands of European
  artists? And more precisely, what version of Indianness would these artists
  have expressed?

    about the text. "You must proceed with much care and diligence to seize
    those books, without any original or copy remaining, and to send them
    carefully guarded at the first opportunity to our Council of the Indies, so
    that they may be examined there. Do not allow any person to write things
    having to do with the superstitions and the way of life of the natives, in
    any language." This English translation was published in Georges Baudot,

    <a href="#_ednref13" name="_edn13" title="">[13]</a> The term Aztec has been
    commonly misused to represent a single culture in Central Mexico. The
    Aztecs, however, were comprised of many diverse cultural groups. The
    <i>Mexica</i> were at the heart of the empire, but the <i>Nahua</i>, for
    example had been a center of power since around 600 BCE and their control
    expanded into areas earlier occupied by Totonacan and Huastec peoples. At
    its height, the Aztec empire expanded from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of
    Mexico, from Central Mexico all the way to what is present day Guatemala, El
    Salvador and Honduras. The empire must be imagined more as an alliance of
    city-states, each boasting its own autonomous control but allied with
    surrounding powers.
