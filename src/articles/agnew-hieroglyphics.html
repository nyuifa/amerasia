<h1>(Afro-)Amerasian Hieroglyphics?</h1>
<h1>The Reception and Interpretation of Mesoamerican Manuscripts in Europe</h1>
<h2>Michael Agnew</h2>
<p>            Modern viewers of the map designed by Caspar Vopel and published by Giovanni Andrea Vavassore in 1558,
    even those aware of sixteenth-century maps that represent Asia and America as a single landmass, are likely to be
    surprised by the close contiguity of East Asian place names alongside Mesoamerican ones. In the region of the map
    labelled Hispania Nova (New Spain), we find Temixtitan (Tenochtitlan, Mexico City) due east of Mangi (Manzi, or
    Southern China) and southeast of Chatay (Cathay, or Northern China), with a Messigo (Mexico) to the west of Mangi
    and a smattering of cities ending in <i>fu</i> (a Chinese administrative division signifying “prefecture”) in the
    same general region as identifiably Mesoamerican place names like Aculuacan (Acolhuacan), all within the lands of
    Asia Magna (Greater Asia) and bordered on the east by what is now known as the Gulf of Mexico but that here is
    labelled Mare Cathayum (“Sea of Cathay”). Vopel’s assertive amalgamation of the newly discovered territories with
    legendary Asian sites may reflect his interest in promoting the idea that Chinese lands fell well within the
    territories of the Spanish Crown, as opposed to those of Portugal, a notion reinforced by his claim to that effect
    in one of the explanatory cartouches that identifies Moctezuma, the ruler of Tenochtitlan, with the Great Khan
    (“Themixitian magni Chan Imperatoris alias Montis Zuma”).<a href="#_edn1"
                                                                name="_ednref1"
                                                                title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
<p>            Regardless of Vopel’s geopolitical thesis, it is worth considering whether his contemporaries would find
    this imbrication of China and Mexico as jarring as it is to us. How could these disparate regions and cultures be so
    closely drawn together in his geographic imaginary that they effectively overlapped? One aspect of the pre-Columbian
    cultures of the Valley of Mexico, their books and pictographic writing—and their reception in Europe<—can help shed
    light on this apparent quandary.</p>
<p>            In a lecture delivered at Villa I Tatti in Florence in 2018, Alexander Nagel drew his audience’s
    attention to a volume now at the Biblioteca Universitaria di Bologna that once belonged to Ferdinando Cospi, a
    seventeenth-century collector who eventually donated his cabinet of curiosities to the Bolognese senate in 1660.<a

            title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a> The preliminary inventory of the collection prepared in 1667 by Lorenzo Legati
    describes the manuscript as a “book from China with various hieroglyphs,” corresponding exactly to what originally
    appeared on the cover of the (European) vellum binding.<a href="#_edn3"
                                                              name="_ednref3"
                                                              title=""><sup>[3]</sup></a> The first part of the original
    inscription was imperfectly erased and corrected to read “Book from <i>Mexico</i> given by the lord Count Valerio
    Zani to the lord Marquis Cospi on December 26, 1665,” but underneath the palimpsest, one can still make out what was
    once there: “Libro della <i>China</i>” [fig. 1].<a
            href="#_edn4"
            name="_ednref4"
            title=""><sup>[4]</sup></a> By the time he prepared his detailed descriptive catalogue of the collection in
    1677, Legati rectified his characterization of the book, echoing the adjustment made to the cover: there it is
    listed as a “Libro messicano.”<a href="#_edn5"
                                     name="_ednref5"
                                     title=""><sup>[5]</sup></a> Did this shift (on the book’s cover and in the
    catalogue) reflect some recognition that the original description was erroneous? Or could “Mexico” and “China”
    somehow have been entirely compatible terms and this change was simply an effort to describe it with greater
    precision, as if “Mexico” were a part of a larger territory called “China” or perhaps adjacent to it in an “Asia
    Magna”? It is difficult to say which. Legati is careful to describe other books and documents from China in the
    collection as “Chinese.”<a href="#_edn6"
                               name="_ednref6"
                               title=""><sup>[6]</sup></a> Presumably he could have known from contemporary maps more
    accurate than Vopel’s that Asia and America were in fact not connected. Yet despite the watery divide of the Pacific
    and the scrupulous cataloguer’s plausible desire for precision, it is nevertheless still possible that he and others
    who consulted the <i>Codex Cospi</i> did not conceive of that division as impeding some fundamental cultural
    connection between (our) East Asia and Mesoamerica.</p>
<p>            In his account of language and knowledge in Europe before the Age of Reason in the second chapter of <i>The
    Order of Things</i>, Michel Foucault describes how the principle of resemblance subtended the interpretation of
    texts and the world in their interpenetrating relationship, highlighting four kinds of similitude in particular: <i>convenientia</i>
    (a “coming together”), expressing the adjacency of things in the great chain of being; <i>aemulatio</i>, or
    similarity between things that are not contiguous on that chain; <i>analogia</i>, a kind of superimposition of <i>convenientia</i>
    and <i>aemulatio</i>, which refers to analogous relationships between sets of things; and, finally, <i>sympathia</i>,
    which (for example) governs the movement of the four elements or the physiological humors and involves a
    transformative displacement of qualities between things that are drawn together because of their supposed
    affinities.<a href="#_edn7"
                  name="_ednref7"
                  title=""><sup>[7]</sup></a> All of these categories involve, in one form or another, an
    epistemological process of <i>assimilation</i>: ascribing similar qualities to otherwise different things.
    Strikingly, though his textual sources in this chapter postdate the Transatlantic encounter between Europe and the
    Americas, Foucault does not delve into the implications of this event, which could surely have tested European
    epistemologies founded on the principle of resemblances and provided one initial basis for the epistemic shift that
    he situates in the Age of Reason. Though one may lament Foucault’s having missed an opportunity to explore the
    intellectual ramifications of European exploration and colonization in Africa, Asia and the Americas, his omission
    is perhaps not entirely surprising, given the concerted efforts European thinkers made during the two centuries
    after Columbus’s voyages to assimilate a “new world” into the preexisting hermeneutic schemas that had developed as
    part of the complex architecture of late medieval and early modern epistemologies.</p>
<p>            The present essay considers one instance of such an assimilation—one that is tied to the domain of books
    and writing, which, as Foucault points out, was privileged over orality in pre- and early modern
    epistemologies.<a href="#_edn8"
                      name="_ednref8"
                      title=""><sup>[8]</sup></a> The European reception and interpretation of the few surviving
    pre-Columbian indigenous manuscripts and of pictographic writing and illustrations in post-conquest codices prepared
    under the watchful eye of missionaries reflects this primacy of the written word and encouraged the incorporation of
    indigenous American writing systems within a larger narrative of the Biblical “confusion of tongues” in the episode
    of the Tower of Babel, with <i>written</i> words understood to be the underlying form of language, and all writing,
    however far removed from its origins before Babel, darkly mirroring the words in the “book of Creation.” Attempts to
    understand Mesoamerican manuscripts can be tied to two intellectual currents, both of which emerged out of
    traditions of esotericism: on the one hand, the images found in emblem books and, on the other, inquiries into the
    history of human languages. Both currents informed European scholars’ interest in Egyptian hieroglyphs and other
    written manifestations of ancient languages; both are tied to a fundamentally visual or scriptural conception of
    language as a mysterious chain of resemblances linking words to things; both depend on allegorical modes of thought
    according to which a single image can encompass a complex statement.</p>
<p>            Europeans who scrutinized these Mesoamerican manuscripts evidently understood the images and pictographs
    to be “hieroglyphs”—a not unreasonable supposition—though what exactly was meant by this term deserves some
    unpacking, especially because they seem to have interpreted not just the pictographs proper as hieroglyphs but also
    what are in fact images of deities and rulers. The term itself emerged in the context of the discovery in 1419 of a
    treatise from late Antiquity on Egyptian symbolic writing, the <i>Hieroglyphica</i> attributed to a certain
    Horapollo (a Hellenized compound of Horus Apollo), and the circulation of that text among Italian humanists in the
    fifteenth century. Renaissance fascination with Egyptian monumental inscriptions was further encouraged by the
    contemporary excavation in Rome of sculptures and obelisks bearing hieroglyphics.<a href="#_edn9"
                                                                                        name="_ednref9"
                                                                                        title=""><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>
<p>            Though Horapollo was no Rosetta Stone, and Europeans remained fundamentally in the dark regarding
    Egyptian writing until 1799, speculation on the meaning of such inscriptions led to inventive “hieroglyphs” of the
    sort that appear in Francesco Colonna’s <i>Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</i> (Venice, 1499), like the famous emblem that
    its printer, Aldus Manutius, adopted as his own device and motto, the dolphin-entwined anchor signifying “festina
    tarde” (or “lente,” hasten slowly), paired with another emblem, a helmet, an ox-skull, and an oil lamp representing
    the idea that “Patience is the ornament, guardian and protector of life” [fig. 2]. A rough genealogy may be drawn
    from Colonna through Andrea Alciato’s moralizing interpretations of emblems in his <i>Emblematum liber</i>
    (Augsburg, 1531) and Pierio Valeriano’s voluminous exegesis of allegorical figures based on commentaries on
    Horapollo, <i>Hieroglyphica sive de sacris Aegyptiorum literis commentarii</i> (Basel, 1556), to the most emblematic
    of emblem books, Cesare Ripa’s <i>Iconologia</i>, published initially without illustrations in Rome in 1593 but soon
    reissued in 1603 with a substantial catalogue of accompanying woodcuts whose number continued to grow in two
    subsequent re-editions before the author’s death in 1622 [figs. 3-5]. Each of these books present complex images
    that today could never be confused with hieroglyphs, though the title of Valeriano’s work makes it clear that the
    term could be plausibly applied to such images in the sixteenth century. Each emblem, furthermore, is accompanied by
    elaborate exegeses suggesting that, in accordance with the contemporary understanding of Egyptian hieroglyphs, the
    images themselves were shorthand for entire complexes of ideas.</p>
<p>            In this light, Lorenzo Legati’s attempt in the expanded catalogue of the Cospi collection at
    understanding the images and pictographs in the <i>Codex Cospi</i>—if not their semantic content, at least their
    function—becomes clearer. His description of the manuscript, following an account of its size and accordion-book
    format (“non è diviso in fogli, come i nostri libri”—it is not divided into leaves, like our books), indicates that
    the book contains “only HIEROGLYPHS from MEXICO, which are very extravagant figures that for the most part portray
    strangely monstrous humans and animals” [fig. 6].<a href="#_edn10"
                                                        name="_ednref10"
                                                        title=""><sup>[10]</sup></a> These he divides into various
    categories, by size: “massimi,” “mediocri,” “menori,” and “minimi.” The penultimate class are arranged in “marginal
    compartments, as if they were (and perhaps they are) marginal notes or commentary on the larger hieroglyphs,” and
    the last “likewise seem to explain the largest hieroglyphs, which they surround like a crown.”<a href="#_edn11"
                                                                                                     name="_ednref11"
                                                                                                     title=""><sup>[11]</sup></a>
    Though Legati fails to find an analogous book form for the manuscript, he does intuit an analogy for the small
    pictographs around the margins (marginal notes or commentaries) and situates the pictographs and illustrations in
    the general category of hieroglyphs, presumably on an Egyptian model—or, rather, on a model that encompassed also
    the elaborate allegories in emblem books, conflating those figures with Egyptian hieroglyphs as they were understood
    by European savants. The examples he provides include an image of the Lord of the House of Dawn,
    Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli (the planet Venus), and a throne, both <i>geroglifici massimi</i> in Legati’s classification.
    The woodcut in the catalogue fails, however, to reflect the fact that this image is a narrative scene in the
    original manuscript, with the fearsome god attacking the throne with his spear. In Legati’s catalogue, the figure
    has been reversed, suggesting that he has interpreted each element as a separate “hieroglyph” [fig. 7; cf. fig. 8].
</p>
<p>            The description of the “Mexican book” appears in the second chapter of the third book of Legati’s full
    catalogue of the Cospi collection, under the rubric of  “Libri, Volume, Carte, e Scritture Esotiche” (Books,
    volumes, documents, and esoteric writings). Here there are various books and ink drawings from China (immediately
    preceding our erstwhile “Chinese” book, now catalogued as “Mexican”). Legati refers to Chinese characters as such
    (<i>caratteri</i>) and not as hieroglyphs, but he does cite at length the humanist and historiographer Cosimo
    Bartoli (1503–1572), who, after explaining that each character represents a word and that they would be better
    described as “cifere” (ciphers), compares Chinese characters to Egyptian hieroglyphs: they are “ingenious work,
    perhaps even more witty than Egyptian hieroglyphs.”<a href="#_edn12"
                                                          name="_ednref12"
                                                          title=""><sup>[12]</sup></a> Legati notes that the Chinese
    write with a brush, not a pen, something he also draws our attention to in the description of the Mexican book:
    “fatture non della Penna, mà del Pennello.”<a href="#_edn13"
                                                  name="_ednref13"
                                                  title=""><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>
<p>            We lack even an approximate date for the creation of the <i>Codex Cospi</i>, but the style of the images
    and pictographs as well as the book’s folded format reflect a decidedly pre-Columbian tradition, even if it might
    have been prepared during the early years of the conquest of Mexico.<a href="#_edn14"
                                                                           name="_ednref14"
                                                                           title=""><sup>[14]</sup></a> Following the
    conquest, missionaries working in the Spanish colonies oversaw the production of newfangled books by indigenous
    informants, scribes, and painters—European-style codices proper, with hinges at the spine—whose imagery likewise
    reflected the influence of European draftsmanship while conserving fundamental aspects of Mesoamerican pictographic
    conventions. One such document is the so-called <i>Codex Mendoza</i>, perhaps commissioned by the first viceroy of
    New Spain, Antonio de Mendoza (thus its conventional name) and in all likelihood prepared during his administration
    (1535–1550). It represents in its first pages a pictorial history of the founding of Tenochtitlán and the reign of
    its first ruler, followed by an accounting of the tributes from conquered territories paid to the Mexica rulers of
    that city [fig. 9]. The last page of the manuscript explains that it was intended to be sent on to Spain. It somehow
    came into the possession of André Thevet, appointed royal cosmographer to Henri II of France around 1553, and his
    signature appears in several places on the manuscript.<a href="#_edn15"
                                                             name="_ednref15"
                                                             title=""><sup>[15]</sup></a> Thevet referred to
    Mesoamerican books in his possession in his own writings and did not hesitate to compare the pictographs and figures
    with Egyptian hieroglyphs, though he wavers in his terminology, also recalling Legati’s description of Chinese
    writing:</p>
<blockquote>the Mexicans, in order to express their ideas, use characters resembling diverse terrestrial and aquatic
    animals and the head, feet, arms, and other limbs of a man, just as the Egyptians and Ethiopians did formerly in
    their hieroglyphic letters…. Two such books I have by me, written by hand in the city of Themistitan, and filled
    with their characters and figures and the interpretations of them.<a href="#_edn16"
                                                                         name="_ednref16"
                                                                         title=""><sup>[16]</sup></a></blockquote>

<p>            When Thevet died, Richard Hakluyt acquired the manuscript, and upon his passing bequeathed it to Samuel
    Purchas, who published a woodcut reproduction of fol. 2 in his <i>Hakluytus posthumus, or, Purchas his Pilgrimes</i>
    (London, 1625) [fig. 10]. This image was in turn copied in a work that brings us full circle, back to the
    esotericism of Renaissance exegetes of <i>emblemata</i>, hieroglyphs, and Hermetic and Kabbalistic texts (and to the
    logic of Foucault’s episteme founded on the principle of similitudes), with the figure of the Jesuit polymath
    Athanasius Kircher, the <i>summum</i> of that tradition as it had developed in the seventeenth century and perhaps
    also its last gasp.</p>
<p>            Kircher included the copy of Purchas’s woodcut of the <i>Codex Mendoza</i> in the last volume of his <i>Oedipus
    Aegyptiacus</i> (Rome, 1652–54) [fig. 11]. This work was the culmination of his studies in ancient languages leading
    to his fanciful and quasi-mystical interpretation of Egyptian hieroglyphics and a reaffirmation of his thesis that
    Egyptian writing (and wisdom and religion) provided the ancient foundations for that of the Indians, the East Asians
    and even the Americans, however distorted and debased that original writing and wisdom had become through the
    process of its dissemination in Antiquity. Or, as he put it in the work where he first formulated the thesis
    extensively, <i>Prodromus Coptus sive Aegyptiacus</i> (Coptic or Egyptian Precursor), published in Rome in 1636,
    “Egypt was the nursery not only of the progress of the Christian religion in distant lands, but also of all the
    superstitions propagated to the world at every time.”<a href="#_edn17"
                                                            name="_ednref17"
                                                            title=""><sup>[17]</sup></a> The Apostles, in spreading the
    gospel of Christ throughout the world, had simply followed the same routes taken by the priests of ancient Egypt.
    Kircher’s vision of language, history, and theology entails some fundamental affinity or similarity spanning a vast
    swath of lands and peoples, from North Africa, across Asia, and into the Americas: “India” writ large, in other
    words, from the “India Maior Aethiopiae” (Greater India of Ethiopia) on Vopel’s map, through “India intra Gangem”
    and “India extra Gangem,” all the way to “India Orientalis” and the lands of the Mexica. Even if maps included in
    Kircher’s publications depict a wide Pacific Ocean (or <i>Mare Australe</i>) and a strait between eastern Siberia
    and Alaska, conceptually at least these territories were effectively contiguous.</p>
<p>            Thus, while Mexican temples might lend themselves to easy comparison with Egyptian pyramids, as in
    Kircher’s discussion of the temple of Huitzilopochtli in a chapter of <i>Oedipus Aegyptiacus</i> titled “De
    religione Americanorum Aegyptiacae parallela” (On the religion of the Americans, a parallel of the Egyptian) [fig.
    12], Asian pagodas do not. Nevertheless, he presents them as “pyramids” as well in his <i>China illustrata</i>
    (Amsterdam, 1667) and correspondingly distorts their representation to confirm their allegedly Egyptian origin and
    thereby supply further evidence for the Egyptian roots of Chinese religion [fig. 13].<a
            href="#_edn18"
            name="_ednref18"
            title=""><sup>[18]</sup></a> Kircher makes a similar move in his treatment of Asian writing systems. In the
    series of encomia to Ferdinand III of Austria composed in dozens of different languages and scripts at the beginning
    of <i>Oedipus Aegyptiacus</i>, Kircher includes one purporting to be in Brahmi script, which he calls “lingua
    hieroglyphica Brachmanum” (hieroglyphic language of the Brahmans). And the origin of Chinese characters, or <i>characteres
        hieroglyphici Sinensium</i>, is likewise Egyptian according to his <i>China illustrata</i>: “The ancient
    Chinese…followed the Egyptians, from whom they are descended: they executed their writing not by a composition of
    letters but by figures constructed from various natural things,” such as the characters he claims are derived from
    images of birds [fig. 14].<a href="#_edn19"
                                 name="_ednref19"
                                 title=""><sup>[19]</sup></a> In any case, Kircher explicitly states his overarching
    thesis at the very beginning of this section of <i>China illustrata</i>, “De Sinensium literatura” (On Chinese
    literature), regarding the peoples of the world who use non-alphabetic writing systems, or <i>characteres
        significativi</i>: “It is certain that three nations, before all other peoples of the world, made use of these
    [characters], namely, the Chinese, the Brahmans, and the Mexicans.”<a
            href="#_edn20"
            name="_ednref20"
            title=""><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>
<p>            However much the accuracy of seventeenth-century maps had improved over Vopel’s vision of the world,
    Kircher’s works suggest that, in certain corners at least, the underlying principles behind Vopel’s organization of
    geography remained in force. Asia and America might well have become clearly delineated continents, but they were
    part of a world in which the dream of recovering a universal, Adamic language—one that preserved a direct
    correspondence between words and things—was still conceivable, for its traces were retrievable in the visual echoes
    of the scripts of ancient and modern languages. This is the ethos evoked in an engraving by Zacharias Dolendo after
    a design by Karel van Mander printed in the last years of the sixteenth century depicting the confusion of tongues
    and peoples after work stopped on the Tower of Babel [fig. 15]. In the foreground, groups of figures carry or hold
    three tablets, each bearing different alphabets, Hebrew, Greek, and Arabic. In the distance, hieroglyphics can be
    made out faintly on an obelisk [fig. 16].<a href="#_edn21"
                                                name="_ednref21"
                                                title=""><sup>[21]</sup></a> Incongruously for a modern viewer, the
    group with the Arabic tablet are naked save for loincloths and headdresses; one wears the stereotypical East Indian
    or Amerindian feather headdress [fig. 17]. Is this an exercise in over-exuberant exoticism, in which truly no one is
    “at home,” as Peter Mason might put it? Or is it an image of literal confusion, with Amerindians carrying off an
