<h1>
    (Afro-)Amerasian Hieroglyphics? The Reception and Interpretation of
    Mesoamerican Manuscripts in Europe
</h1>
<h2>Michael Agnew</h2>
<p>
    Modern viewers of the map designed by Caspar Vopel and published by Giovanni
    Andrea Vavassore in 1558, even when aware of contemporary representations of
    Asia and America as a single landmass, are likely to be surprised by the close
    contiguity of East Asian place names alongside Mesoamerican ones. In the
    region of the map labelled Hispania Nova (New Spain), we find Temixtitan
    (Tenochtitlan, Mexico City) due east of Mangi (Manzi, or Southern China) and
    southeast of Chatay (Cathay, or Northern China), with a Messigo (Mexico) to
    the west of Mangi and a smattering of cities ending in <i>fu</i> (a Chinese
    administrative division signifying "prefecture") in the same general region as
    identifiably Mesoamerican place names like Aculuacan (Acolhuacan), all within
    the lands of Asia Magna (Greater Asia) and bordered on the east by what is now
    known as the Gulf of Mexico but that here is labelled Mare Cathayum (Sea of
    Cathay). Vopel's assertive amalgamation of newly discovered territories with
    East Asian geography promotes the idea that Chinese lands fell well within the
    territorial claims of the Spanish Crown, and not Portugal's. His explanatory
    cartouches that identify Moctezuma, the ruler of Tenochtitlan, with the Great
    Khan, reinforce this notion.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a>
</p>
<p>
    Regardless of Vopel's geopolitical thesis, it is worth considering whether his
    contemporaries would find this imbrication of China and Mexico as jarring as
    it is to us. How could these disparate regions and cultures be so closely
    drawn together in his geographic imaginary that they effectively overlapped?
    The European reception and understanding of one aspect of the pre-Columbian
    cultures of the Valley of Mexico, their books and pictographic writing, can
    help shed light on this apparent quandary.

    Alexander Nagel has drawn attention to a volume now in the Biblioteca
    Universitaria di Bologna that once belonged to Ferdinando Cospi, a
    seventeenth-century collector who eventually donated his cabinet of
    curiosities to the Bolognese senate in 1660.<a

    As Nagel notes, the preliminary inventory of Cospi's collection, prepared in
    1667 by Lorenzo Legati, describes the manuscript as a "book from China with
    various hieroglyphs," corresponding exactly to what originally appeared on the
    cover of the (European) vellum binding, which at the time read "Libro della
    China" [Fig. 1].<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a>

</p>
<p>
    The first part of the original inscription was imperfectly erased and
    corrected to read, "Book from <i>Mexico</i> given by the lord Count Valerio
    Zani to the lord Marquis Cospi on December 26, 1665." Underneath the
    palimpsest, however, one can still vaguely make out the original "Libro della
    <i>China</i>" [Fig. 1].<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a> When
    Legati prepared a detailed descriptive catalogue of the Cospi collection a
    decade later in 1677, he rectified his characterization of the book, listing
    it as a "Libro messicano."<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a>
    Did this shift (on the book's cover and in the catalogue) reflect some
    recognition that Legati's original description was erroneous? Or could
    "Mexico" and "China" somehow have been entirely compatible terms, and this
    change was simply an effort to describe it with greater precision, as if
    "Mexico" were a part of a larger territory called "China" or perhaps adjacent
    to it in an "Asia Magna"? It is difficult to say which. Legati is careful to
    describe other books and documents from China in the collection as
    "Chinese."<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> Presumably he
    could have known from contemporary maps more accurate than Vopel's that Asia
    and America were in fact not connected. Yet despite the watery divide of the
    Pacific and the scrupulous cataloguer's plausible desire for precision, it is
    nevertheless still possible that he and others who consulted the Codex Cospi
    did not conceive of that division as impeding some fundamental cultural
    connection between (our) East Asia and Mesoamerica.

    In the second chapter of his account of language and knowledge in Europe
    before the Age of Reason in <i>The Order of Things</i>, Michel Foucault
    describes how the principle of resemblance subtended the interpretation of
    texts and the world in their interpenetrating relationship. Specifically, he
    defines four kinds of similitude: <i>convenientia</i>, a coming together
    expressing the adjacency of things in the great chain of being;
    <i>aemulatio</i>, or similarity between things that are not contiguous on that
    chain; <i>analogia</i>, a kind of superimposition of <i>convenientia</i> and
    <i>aemulatio</i>, which refers to analogous relationships between sets of
    things; and, finally, <i>sympathia</i>, which (for example) governs the
    movement of the four elements or the physiological humors and involves a
    transformative displacement of qualities between disparate things in the
    natural world (humors, elements, planets) that are connected at a distance
    because of their supposed affinities.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""
>[7]</a
>
</p>
<p>
    All of these categories involve, in one form or another, an epistemological
    process of <i>assimilation</i>: ascribing similar qualities to otherwise
    different things. Strikingly, though his sources postdate the Transatlantic
    encounter between Europe and the Americas, Foucault does not explore the
    implications of these historical events, which surely could have tested
    European modes of thought founded on the principle of resemblances and
    provided a basis for the epistemic shift towards a taxonomic order based on
    the principle of difference that he situates in the Age of Reason. Foucault
    misses an opportunity to examine the intellectual ramifications of European
    exploration and colonization in Africa, Asia and the Americas, but his
    omission is perhaps not entirely surprising, given the concerted efforts
    European thinkers made during the two centuries after Columbus's voyages to
    assimilate a "New World" into the preexisting hermeneutic schemas that had
    developed as part of the complex architecture of late medieval and early
    modern epistemologies.
</p>
<p>
    One such instance of assimilation, tied to the domain of books and
    writing&#8212;which, as Foucault points out, was privileged over orality in
    early modern Europe&#8212;Is European interpretation of the pictographic
    writing and illustrations in the few surviving examples of pre-Columbian
    manuscripts and in post-conquest codices prepared under the watchful eye of
    missionaries.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a> Their reception
    in Europe reflects the primacy of the written word and encouraged the
    incorporation of indigenous American writing systems within a larger narrative
    of the Biblical "confusion of tongues" in the episode of the Tower of Babel,
    with <i>written</i> words understood to be the underlying form of language,
    and all writing, however far removed from its origins before Babel, darkly
    mirroring the words in the "book of Creation." European attempts to understand
    Mesoamerican manuscripts can be tied to two intellectual currents, both of
    which emerged out of traditions of esotericism: on the one hand, the images
    found in emblem books, and, on the other, inquiries into the history of human
    languages. Both currents informed European scholars' interest in Egyptian
    hieroglyphs and other written manifestations of ancient languages; both are
    tied to a fundamentally visual or scriptural conception of language as a
    mysterious chain of resemblances linking words to things; both depend on
    allegorical modes of thought according to which a single image can encompass a
    complex statement.
</p>
<p>
    Europeans who scrutinized Mesoamerican manuscripts understood their images and
    pictographs to be analogous to Egyptian hieroglyphs, a comparison that Pietro
    Martire d'Anghiera makes in his fourth <i>Decade</i> (first published in 1521)
    when discussing Mesoamerican books: "The characters are very different from
    ours, laid out line-by-line as we do, with small blocks, hooks, loops, lines,
    stars, and other shapes. They almost resemble Egyptian letter-forms."<a
        href="#_edn9"
        name="_ednref9"
        title=""
>[9]</a
>
    This was not an unreasonable supposition. Though Pietro Martire does not use
    the precise term <i>hieroglyphs</i>, what exactly that concept encompassed in
    the early modern period deserves some unpacking, especially because Legati
    seems to have interpreted not just the pictographs proper in the Codex Cospi
    as hieroglyphs but also what are in fact illustrations depicting deities and
    rulers. The word emerged in the context of the discovery in 1419 of a treatise
    from late antiquity on Egyptian symbolic writing, the
    <i>Hieroglyphica</i> attributed to a certain Horapollo (a Hellenized compound
    of Horus Apollo), which circulated among Italian humanists. Early modern
    fascination with Egyptian monumental inscriptions was further encouraged by
    the contemporary excavation in Rome of sculptures and obelisks bearing
    hieroglyphics.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a>
</p>
<p>
    Although Horapollo's <i>Hieroglyphica</i> was no Rosetta Stone, and Europeans
    remained fundamentally in the dark regarding Egyptian writing until 1799,
    speculation about the meaning of Egyptian inscriptions prompted Europeans
    themselves to create inventive "hieroglyphs" of the sort that appear in
    Francesco Colonna's <i>Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</i> (Venice, 1499). Most
    famous among them perhaps is the emblem that its printer, Aldus Manutius,
    later adopted as his own device and motto, the dolphin-entwined anchor
    signifying <i>festina tarde</i> (or <i>lente</i>, "hasten slowly"), paired in
    the illustration in Colonna's book with another emblem: a helmet, an ox-skull,
    and an oil lamp representing the idea that Patience is the ornament, guardian
    and protector of life [Fig. 2].

    A rough genealogy may be drawn from Colonna through Andrea Alciato's
    moralizing interpretations of emblems in his
    <i>Emblematum liber</i> (Augsburg, 1531), through Pierio Valeriano's
    voluminous exegesis of allegorical figures based on commentaries on Horapollo,
    <i>Hieroglyphica sive de sacris Aegyptiorum literis commentarii</i> (Basel,
    1556), to the most emblematic of emblem books, Cesare Ripa's
    <i>Iconologia</i>, published initially without illustrations in Rome in 1593
    and soon reissued in 1603 with accompanying woodcuts whose number continued to
    grow in two subsequent re-editions before the author's death in 1622 [figs.
    3-5].

    Each of these books present complex images that today could never be confused
    with hieroglyphs, though the title of Valeriano's work makes it clear that the
    term could be plausibly applied to such images in the sixteenth century. Each
    emblem, furthermore, is accompanied by elaborate exegeses suggesting that, in
    accordance with the contemporary understanding of Egyptian hieroglyphs, the
    images could function as shorthand for entire complexes of ideas.
</p>
<p>
    In this light, Lorenzo Legati's attempt to understand the images and
    pictographs in the Codex Cospi&#8212;if not their semantic content, at least
    their function&#8212;becomes clearer. His description of the manuscript,
    following an account of its size and accordion-book format ("it is not divided
    into leaves, like our books"), indicates that the book contains "only
    HIEROGLYPHS from MEXICO"&#8212;Legati's uppercase&#8212;"which are very
    extravagant figures that for the most part portray strangely monstrous humans
    and animals" [Fig. 6].<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a>

    These he divides into various categories, by size: "massimi," "mediocri,"
    "menori," and "minimi." The penultimate class, "lesser" figures, are arranged
    in "marginal compartments, as if they were (and perhaps they are) marginal
    notes or commentary on the larger hieroglyphs," and the last group, the
    smallest, "likewise seem to explain the largest hieroglyphs, which they
    surround like a crown."<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a>
    Though Legati identifies no analogous format for the manuscript (like an Asian
    accordion book), he does intuit an analogy for the small pictographs around
    the margins ("marginal notes or commentary") and situates the pictographs and
    illustrations in the general category of hieroglyphs, presumably basing his
    assessment on an Egyptian model&#8212;or, rather, on a model that encompassed
    also the elaborate allegories in emblem books, conflating those figures with
    Egyptian hieroglyphs as they were understood by European savants. The examples
    he provides include an image of the Lord of the House of Dawn,
    Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli (the planet Venus), and a throne, both
    <i>geroglifici massimi</i> in Legati's classification. The woodcut
    reproduction in Legati's catalogue, however, misrepresents what in the
    original manuscript is a narrative scene in which a fearsome god attacks the
    throne with his spear. In the catalogue, the figure has been reversed and does
    not interact with the throne, suggesting that Legati interpreted each element
    as a separate "hieroglyph" [Fig. 7; cf. Fig. 8] .

<p>
    Legati's description of the <i>libro messicano</i> appears in the second
    chapter of the third book of his full catalogue of the Cospi collection, under
    the rubric of "Books, volumes, documents, and esoteric writings" ("Libri,
    volume, carte, e scritture esotiche"). This section also includes various
    books and ink drawings from China, which immediately precede the erstwhile
    "Chinese" book, now catalogued as "Mexican." Legati refers to Chinese
    characters as such (<i>caratteri</i>) and not as hieroglyphs. Nevertheless, he
    cites at length the humanist and historiographer Cosimo Bartoli
    (1503&#8211;1572), who, after explaining that each character represents a word
    and that they would be better ddescribed as ciphers <i>(cifere)</i>, explicitly
    compares Chinese characters to Egyptian writing: they are "ingenious work,
    perhaps even more witty than Egyptian hieroglyphs."<a
        href="#_edn13"
        name="_ednref13"
        title=""
>[13]</a

    Legati notes that the Chinese write with a brush, something he also draws our
    attention to in the description of the Mexican book, which contains "works not
    of the pen but of the brush."<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""

</p>
<p>
    We lack even an approximate date for the creation of the Codex Cospi, but the
    style of the images and pictographs as well as the book's folded format
    reflect a decidedly pre-Columbian tradition, even if it was in fact prepared
    during the early years of the conquest of Mexico.<a

    Following the conquest, missionaries working in the Spanish colonies oversaw
    the production of newfangled books by indigenous informants, scribes, and
    painters: European-style codices proper, with hinges at the spine, whose
    imagery reflected the influence of European draftsmanship while conserving
    fundamental aspects of Mesoamerican pictographic conventions. (link to <a href="#raitt-florentinecodex">Raitt
    essay</a> on the Florentine Codex). One such document is the so-called Codex
    Mendoza, perhaps commissioned by the first viceroy of New Spain, Antonio de
    Mendoza and probably prepared during his administration (1535&#8211;1550). The
    book presents a pictorial history of the founding of Tenochtitlan and the
    reign of its first ruler, followed by an accounting of the tributes paid to
    the Mexica rulers of that city by conquered territories [Fig. 9].

    The last page of the manuscript explains that it was intended to be sent to
    Spain. It somehow instead came into the possession of André Thevet, Henri II
    of France's royal cosmographer in the mid-sixteenth century, whose signature
    appears in several places on the manuscript.<a
        href="#_edn16"
        name="_ednref16"
        title=""
>[16]</a
>
    In his own writings, Thevet did not hesitate to compare Mesoamerican
    pictographs and figures with Egyptian hieroglyphs, though he wavers in his
    terminology, recalling Legati's description of Chinese writing:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
    the Mexicans, in order to express their ideas, use characters resembling
    diverse terrestrial and aquatic animals and the head, feet, arms, and other
    limbs of a man, just as the Egyptians and Ethiopians did formerly in their
    hieroglyphic letters. Two such books I have by me, written by hand in the city
    of Themistitan, and filled with their characters and figures and the
    interpretations of them.<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a>
</blockquote>

When Thevet died, Richard Hakluyt acquired the manuscript, and upon his passing
bequeathed it to Samuel Purchas, who published a woodcut reproduction of the
opening illustration of the Codex Mendoza in his
Hakluytus posthumus, or, Purchas his Pilgrimes (London, 1625) [Fig. 10].

    This image was in turn copied in a work that brings us full circle, back to
    the esotericism of Renaissance exegetes of <i>emblemata</i>, hieroglyphs, and
    Hermetic and Kabbalistic texts (as well as to the logic of Foucault's episteme
    founded on the principle of similitudes), with the figure of the Jesuit
    polymath Athanasius Kircher, the <i>summum</i> of that tradition as it had
    developed in the seventeenth century and perhaps also its last gasp.
</p>
<p>
    Kircher included a copy of Purchas's woodcut of the Codex Mendoza in the last
    volume of his <i>Oedipus Aegyptiacus</i> (Rome, 1652&#8211;54) [Fig. 11].

</p>
<p>
    This work was the culmination of Kircher's studies in ancient languages,
    presenting a fanciful and quasi-mystical interpretation of Egyptian
    hieroglyphics and a reaffirmation of his thesis that Egyptian writing (and
    wisdom and religion) provided the ancient foundations for that of the Indians,
    the East Asians, and even the Americans, however distorted and debased (in
    Kircher's understanding) that original writing and wisdom had become through
    the process of its dissemination in Antiquity. Or, as he put it in the work
    where he first formulated the thesis extensively, his
    <i>Prodromus Coptus sive Aegyptiacus</i> (Coptic or Egyptian Precursor,
    published in Rome in 1636), "Egypt was the nursery not only of the progress of
    the Christian religion in distant lands, but also of all the superstitions
    propagated to the world at every time."<a

    For Kircher, in spreading the gospel of Christ throughout the world, the
    Apostles had simply followed the same routes taken by the priests of ancient
    Egypt in propagating their wisdom and writing to the rest of humanity beyond
    Europe. (link to <a href="#walsh-thomas">Walsh essay on St. Thomas</a>) Kircher's vision of language,
    history, and theology entails some fundamental affinity or similarity spanning
    a vast swath of lands and peoples, from North Africa, across Asia, and into
    the Americas: "India" writ large, in other words, from Vopel's "India Maior
    Aethiopiae" (Greater India of Ethiopia) in Africa, through his "India intra
    Gangem" (India before the Ganges) and "India extra Gangem" (India beyond the
    Ganges), all the way to the "India Orientalis" in "Asia Magna" (his Greater
    Asia, a label that appears in our North America) and the lands of the Mexica.
    Even though maps included in Kircher's publications depict a wide Pacific
    Ocean (or <i>Mare Australe</i>) and a strait between eastern Siberia and
    Alaska, conceptually at least these territories were contiguous.
</p>
<p>
    Thus, while Mexican temples might lend themselves to easy comparison with
    Egyptian pyramids, as Kircher explicitly does in his discussion of the temple
    of Huitzilopochtli in the chapter of <i>Oedipus Aegyptiacus</i> titled "On the
    religion of the Americans, a parallel of the Egyptian" ("De religione
    Americanorum Aegyptiacae parallela") [Fig. 12], Asian pagodas do not.

    In the accompanying illustrations, furthermore, he distorts their
    representation, making them seem more "pyramidal," in order to assert their
    allegedly Egyptian origin and to bolster his claim that the roots of Chinese
    religion lay in Egypt [Fig. 13].<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""

<p>
    Kircher makes a similar move in his treatment of Asian writing systems. In the
    series of encomia to Ferdinand III of Austria composed in dozens of different
    languages and scripts at the beginning of <i>Oedipus Aegyptiacus</i>, Kircher
    includes one purporting to be in Brahmi script, which he calls "hieroglyphic
    language of the Brahmans" ("lingua hieroglyphica Brachmanum"). And the origin
    of Chinese "hieroglyphic" characters ("characteres hieroglyphici Sinensium")
    is likewise Egyptian according to his <i>China illustrata</i>: "The ancient
    Chinese followed the Egyptians, from whom they are descended: they executed
    their writing not by a composition of letters but by figures constructed from
    various natural things," such as the characters he claims are derived from
    images of birds [Fig. 14].<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[21]</a>

<p>
    Kircher states his overarching thesis regarding the cultural genealogy of the
    peoples of the world who use non-alphabetic writing systems, or
    <i>characteres significativi</i>, at the beginning of this same section of
    <i>China illustrata</i>, titled "On Chinese Literature" (<i>De Sinensium
    literatura</i>): "it is certain that three nations, before all other peoples of
    the world, made use of these [characters], namely, the Chinese, the Brahmans,
    and the Mexicans."<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[22]</a>
</p>
<p>
    However much the accuracy of seventeenth-century maps had improved over
    Vopel's vision of the world, Kircher's works suggest that, in certain corners
    at least, the underlying principles behind Vopel's organization of geography
    remained in force. Asia and America might well have become clearly delineated
    continents, but they were part of a world in which the dream of recovering a
    universal, Adamic language&#8212;one that preserved a direct correspondence
    between words and things&#8212;was still conceivable, for its traces were
    retrievable in the visual echoes of the scripts of ancient and modern
    languages. This is the ethos evoked in an engraving by Zacharias Dolendo after
    a design by Karel van Mander printed in the last years of the sixteenth
    century depicting the confusion of tongues and peoples after work stopped on
    the Tower of Babel [Fig. 15].

    Or is it an image of literal confusion, with Amerindians carrying off an
    Arabic primer that will serve them no purpose&#8212;like the man in an Ottoman
    turban who seems to struggle at deciphering the Greek? Or perhaps they are the
    "Amerasian" children of Shem about to head eastward towards what will be their
    new home, Vopel's <i>Asia Magna</i>.
