    I do not think it would be easy for me to recount with a few words the voyage
    of the illustrious man, worthy of celebration in eternal memory, Ferdinand
    Magellan. For many years this man, the commander of the ships of Portugal, had
    traversed the shores of the entire East, and, having crossed the limits of
    Portuguese territories, he had made trade with the peoples of China, who—he
    was demonstrating and reporting—belonged to the territory of the Castilians.
    On account of these injustices inflicted upon him by the king of Portugal, he
    retreated into Castile. By far the most certain conclusion to be inferred is
    that it is to be believed that the Moluccas, filled with types of every spice,
    are contained within the limits of the Castilians. The Unconquerable Caesar
    provided a fleet of five ships, and Magellan was placed in command as the
    leader of these. Then, Magellan set sail with the five ships from Seville on
    August 10, 1519, and within a few days arrived at the Fortunate Isles [the
    Canaries, see on map “FORTUNAta insulae ”]. From there, to the Hesperides
    [Cape Verde, see on map “Hesperidum insulae ”], from which they began their
    journey to America, [where] they discovered a promontory, the name for which
    is Santa Maria [see on map “C. S. Mariae promontorio dive virginis ”]. From
    there, at the end of March of the following year, they were carried down to
    the port of Saint Julian [on map “P. Iuliani”], where they were suffering an
    especially bitter winter in May; and indeed, now in our summer, there one must
    suffer winter. From there, setting sail again on August 24, they arrived at
    the Province of the Cross on November 26 [see map, “C. Crucis”]. When that
    place had been abandoned and the narrow sea crossed, they came to the
    Unfortunate Isles [see map, just north of the Tropic of Capricorn “Insule
    infortunatae ”]. Then, after four months, they came to Inuagana [on map, near
    the figure of Magellan, “Inuagana”], and from there to the Moluccas [on map,
    just north of the equator, “Moluccae insulae ”], where they loaded the ships
    with cloves. Then, when the Spaniards had set sail from Tidore [on map, “Mare
    Theodore ”] through the deep Indian Ocean, giving their sails to the wind once
    they had navigated past the Cape of Good Hope, they arrived again in Spain on
    September 6, 1522, at the nearby port of Seville.
