<h1>America Nova Orbis Pars</h1>

<p>
    This region is described as America, and is held to be one part of the New
    World, <em>Nova Orbis</em>. In this sense, the Vopel map follows the 1507 map
    by Martin Waldseemüller, which named the newly discovered southern landmass
    America after the explorer Amerigo Vespucci. After Vespucci and Waldseemüller,
    this southern territory was often labeled Mundus Novus (as we see, for
    example, in the Ruysch map of 1507 and the roughly contemporary Hunt Lenox
    Globe) or Novus Orbis (as we see for example in Sebastian Münster’s 1540 map
    of the “new Islands,” <em>Novae Insulae</em>). If the territory north of this
    southern landmass was understood by many, well into the seventeenth century,
    to extend into Asia, agreement formed early on that this southern landmass was
    a distinctly new addition to the world known since Antiquity. In keeping with
    the Spanish orientation governing the map as a whole, Vopel ascribes the
    discovery of this territory to Columbus, in 1497 (when he landed at the mouth
    of the Orinoco river on his third voyage), and clearly states that Columbus’
    voyage was undertaken at the behest of the Spanish kings.
