<h1>
    Conceptualizing Amerasia: Medici Worldview in Ludovico Buti’s Armory frescoes
</h1>
<h2>Margo Weitzman</h2>

<p>
    When Francesco I de’ Medici died in 1587, the family armory was still
    incomplete. Francesco’s brother, Ferdinando I, who succeeded him as Duke of
    Tuscany, rushed to decorate the armory before his wedding to Christina of
    Lorraine. The room contained weapons and armor from around the world,
    including the New World and India, acquired by Francesco, an avid collector.<a

    In 1588, Medici court artist Ludovico Buti completed frescoes on the armory’s
    ceiling depicting four international battle scenes to accompany the weapons on
    display, now gallery room 20 in the Uffizi in Florence (<i>figure 1, 2</i>).
    The grotesque tracery design was common during this period, particularly for
    armory ceilings, but in this case bolsters the fantastic forms of New World
    discoveries.<a href="#_weitzman_edn2" name="_weitzman_ednref2" title=""
><sup>[2]</sup></a
>
    Although exceedingly wealthy, the Medici did not have the financial
    wherewithal to fund their own New World expeditions. Because the room
    displayed the Medici arms collection and was considered a social space, it is
    likely that Ferdinando, as the new Duke, intended to utilize the room to
    project his family’s wealth and power to the wedding guests and other
    dignitaries. Ludovico Buti served these needs by presenting an amalgamation of
    New World cultures and conquests by utilizing prints, maps, and texts
    circulating within the Medici cultural milieu. While current scholarship has
    demonstrated that there are clear political agendas addressed in the armory’s
    imagery which align the family with Spain and Portugal, I argue that Buti’s
    intermix of disparate cultures also reveals the Medici considered New World
    objects to be only loosely separate from the Asian continent during the late
    Cinquecento. By interlacing the New World with India, the armory’s imagery
    reveals a court culture in which the definition of the Americas was still in
    flux. As such, the fresco reflects Francesco’s desire to have agency in New
    World discoveries, while simultaneously revealing a broader resistance to
    modifying the continent’s Ptolemaic, and thus anachronistic, connection to
    Asia.
</p>
<p>
    The armory’s four battle scenes fan out from the center of the ceiling and
    depict conflicts between Western European armies and natives from America,
    Africa, and Asia. The scenes to the ceiling’s north and south feature imagery
    with clear cultural signifiers and some indication of geography, although it
    is not totally conclusive, whereas the east and west scenes are less
    straightforward. The battle located to the north (<i>figure 3</i>) depicts the
    Medici, as signified by the <i>palle</i> banner paraded on horseback,
    defeating the Turks in striped turbans who clamor up the side of a hill after
    dropping their crescent moon flag. The background is less clear as a
    nondescript maritime setting, which could depict the battle of Piombino, a
    crucial trade port developed by Ferdinando.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn3"
        name="_weitzman_ednref3"
        title=""
><sup>[3]</sup></a
>
    Directly below the scene is a marginal rectangular gold box with tracery
    design containing two elephants and spiky palms. The opposite battle on the
    southern side of the ceiling (<i>figure 4</i>) could be a clash between the
    Spanish, as signified by the red and white standard,<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn4"
        name="_weitzman_ednref4"
        title=""
><sup>[4]</sup></a
>
    and New World feathered natives, who defend themselves with spears and shields
    against the far superior European guns.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn5"
        name="_weitzman_ednref5"
        title=""
><sup>[5]</sup></a
>
    The background is dotted with tropical foliage and arched huts cascading along
    rolling hills, and another small rectangular box is positioned below the scene
    containing a native standing contrapposto with a rhinoceros.
</p>
<p>
    The scenes on the east and west ends of the ceiling are less detailed and more
    difficult to identify. Lia Markey argues the skin color, dress, and weaponry
    of the natives are evidence that the two scenes are battles between Turks and
    Africans (<i>figure 5</i>), and Islamic North Africa and the Portuguese (<i
>figure 6</i
>).<a href="#_weitzman_edn6" name="_weitzman_ednref6" title=""
><sup>[6]</sup></a
>
    The Turks in the lower left corner of the African scene are identifiable based
    on their striped clothing and turbans. However, the identity of their
    opponents is not decidedly African. Given the figures are wearing loin cloths
    and carrying bows and swords, and the setting is mountainous and hilly, with
    tropical foliage containing low huts featured in Buti’s American battle
    between the Spanish, the sense of place is muddied and could also be
    identified as a New World setting. The battle between Islamic North Africa and
    the Portuguese is similarly convoluted.
</p>
<p>
    The central <i>tondo </i>(<i>figure 7</i>) unites the four battle scenes and
    acts as a sharp foil to their frenetic energy and violence. It is idyllic,
    with tropical foliage and a hint of architecture in the background, devoid of
    both war and European figures. In the foreground, seven men wearing striped
    loin cloths and full feathered headdresses, carrying arrows and a parasol,
    parade a cloaked regal figure across the edge of the frame. The “chief”
    carries what appears to be a type of battle axe, which was likely similar to
    one on view in the armory. The parade of natives is a spectacle of mannered
    and classicizing poses, weapons, and display of exotica, which Peter Mason
    considers a hybrid assemblage of motifs that has moved away from ethnographic
    accuracy.<a href="#_weitzman_edn7" name="_weitzman_ednref7" title=""
><sup>[7]</sup></a
>
    The headdressed natives set in an architectural tropical landscape are
    congruent with the inexact exotica in rest of the scenes. Who, and where, are
    these natives?
</p>
<p>
    The ambiguous geographic locations and fluidity of iconographic signifiers in
    all four battle scenes bring to bear the scholarly problem of discerning how
    the Medici defined America and its natives, landmasses, and objects. The
    conflated idea of “Amerasia,” a term that refers to the amalgamation of
    America and Asia in sixteenth-century maps, imagery, and texts, is a problem
    circulating through current scholarly arguments with no resolution. In the
    case of Buti’s armory fresco, Amerasian imagery is present in the battle
    between the Medici and American natives, particularly in the rhinoceros below,
    and the central <i>tondo</i> in which architectural details, flora, and native
    dress blur demarcation between New World Americas and broadly southern Asian
    signifiers such as bananas,<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn8"
        name="_weitzman_ednref8"
        title=""
><sup>[8]</sup></a
>
    a parasol, and the chief’s bier (a trope that will be examined later through
    circulating prints). In her seminal 2015 book
    <i>Imagining the Americas in Medici Florence</i>, Lia Markey argues that by
    using cultural generalizations to contextualize Medici weaponry, Buti’s
    ceiling is a theatrical performance of foreign natives whose ethnographic
    rendering was intended to demonstrate the weapons in use while also
    politically aligning the Medici with New World discoveries.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn9"
        name="_weitzman_ednref9"
        title=""
><sup>[9]</sup></a
>
    Ultimately, Markey argues that Ferdinando was responding to Philip II, King of
    Spain, Portugal, and Sicily, who banned Amerasian imagery because of its
    blasphemous content. Ferdinando was careful not to undermine Philip’s desires
    because the Medici depended on Spain’s financial partnership.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn10"
        name="_weitzman_ednref10"
        title=""
><sup>[10]</sup></a
>
</p>
<p>
    However, with the problem of Amerasia in mind, additional connotations emerge
    from the frescoes’ details when considering contemporary costume books, texts,
    and maps that would have been familiar to the Medici court. Although the
    Medici likely viewed these lands as separate continents and conquests, they
    might also have conceptualized America and Asia as a region of the world where
    the East met the West. Thus, in utilizing ubiquitous reference materials
    present within the Medici milieu, the contemporary viewer might have
    understood the multifarious signifiers in Buti’s imagery as depicting a New
    World in close concert with India and Southeast Asia, as well as the Medici
    alignment to these conquests through collections and political alliances
    displayed prominently in the armory. There is little scholarship outside of
    Markey’s work that considers the social implications of Buti’s fresco. In
    addition to its theatricality and political implications, Buti’s iconography
    has an ideological demarcation that is worth investigating.
</p>
<p>
    At the intersection of Asian and New World iconography are ethnographic
    composites of disparate New World cultures. The mixing of New World societies
    through objects and depictions of its natives, particularly Aztec and
    Brazilian in this case, should be examined at the outset, because the larger
    issue of cultural overlap between Asia and New World imagery is partly rooted
    in an unclear definition of the word “Indian.”<b> </b>In 1588, when Ferdinando
    assumed responsibility for completing the armory decoration, the definition of
    terms such as “New World” and “Indian” were still decidedly fluid; “New World”
    could refer to newly discovered lands of both the east and west. (On the range
    of meanings of the word India and Indians,
    <a href="#riccio-india">see the entry by Vittoria Riccio</a>.) Ferdinando’s
    collection inventories from c.1571 to 1588 use the terms <i>Indiana</i>,
    <i>alla Indiana</i>, and <i>dell</i><i>’</i><i>Indie </i>to define objects
    from the Americas, India, of Moorish origin, and Asia more generally.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn11"
        name="_weitzman_ednref11"
        title=""
><sup>[11]</sup></a
>
    The word “Indian” itself is loaded and imprecise. Jessica Keating and Lia
    Markey’s research reveals that the term has often been taken for granted in
    current scholarly research, and could refer to anything that is of abundance,
    exotic, of a “foreign” style, or simply non-European.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn12"
        name="_weitzman_ednref12"
        title=""
><sup>[12]</sup></a
>
    In order to create believable and verisimilar imagery of places and people
    neither Buti nor Francesco had ever seen firsthand, Buti borrowed from
    multiple sources that originated from both the broader continent of Europe and
    the New World, further augmenting the ambiguity of these terms.
</p>
<p>
    Markey has already examined Bernardino de Sahagún’s c.1577
    <i>Florentine Codex—</i>an important source for Buti’s imagery that belonged
    to Ferdinando. The <i>Codex</i>, a three-volume illustrated manuscript,
    documents the lives of the Aztecs during the conquest of New Spain.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn13"
        name="_weitzman_ednref13"
        title=""
><sup>[13]</sup></a
>
    It is considered to be one of the most thorough and important documents
    describing Aztec and Mexican culture and the flora of the region.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn14"
        name="_weitzman_ednref14"
        title=""
><sup>[14]</sup></a
>
    (On the Florentine Codex owned by Ferdinando I de Medici,
    <a href="#raitt-florentinecodex">see the entry by Louisa Raitt</a>.) Markey
    also demonstrates that Buti’s quotations range from codices to circulating
    Flemish, French, and German prints, further demonstrating his appropriation of
    a variety of sources for the armory ceiling imagery.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn15"
        name="_weitzman_ednref15"
        title=""
><sup>[15]</sup></a
>
    Another possible influence on Buti’s imagery worth considering is the two
    Amerasian figures in Christopher Weiditz’s c.1530s <i>Trachtenbuch </i>(<i
>figure 8</i
>), an illustrated costume book that in itself carries further significance
    because of its commixture of native cultures. Although the
    <i>Trachtenbuch</i> was not widely circulated, Weiditz’s illustrations were
    disseminated separately as copies.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn16"
        name="_weitzman_ednref16"
        title=""
><sup>[16]</sup></a
>
    The manuscript showcases contemporary dress belonging to varied social ranks
    including indigenous Aztecs. The natives’ loincloths and the blue and red
    bulky striped cape draped over the king in Buti’s center <i>tondo</i> are as
    close to Weiditz’s imagery as other scholarly comparisons to the<i> Codex</i>.
    Elizabeth Boone argues Weiditz’s images are more sartorial than accurate, as
    many of his drawings are glossed as Aztecs but dressed in Brazilian feathered
    skirts and headdresses—again, exoticizing the figures by converging
    ethnographic elements from a variety of sources.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn17"
        name="_weitzman_ednref17"
        title=""
><sup>[17]</sup></a
>
    Buti’s own combination of the <i>Codex </i>and <i>Trachtenbuch </i>is thus a
    response to the larger pedagogical environment within the court driven by
    costume books and circulating prints.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn18"
        name="_weitzman_ednref18"
        title=""
><sup>[18]</sup></a
>
</p>
<p>
    The influence of itinerant print materials on Ludovico Buti’s imagery also
    extended to widely circulated continental allegories. Coupled with the
    fluidity of regional definitions applied to Medici inventory, Giovanni
    Stradano’s c.1580s “Vespucci’s Voyage of Discovery” print from the
    <i>Americae Retectio </i>(<i>figure 9</i>), drawing from the legacy of Amerigo
    Vespucci and his ties to the Medici, provides additional information regarding
    how the Medici sought to project themselves and their view of the New World.
    Created in the Medici court during the time Ferdinando transitioned to Duke,
    Stradano celebrates Vespucci, who stands tall on his ship with his family coat
    of arms blowing in the wind, with the Spanish standard below. The city of
    Florence is represented by Mars riding a turtle pulled by lions, and Minerva
    to the lower right, with lilies symbolizing the Virgin of Florence.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn19"
        name="_weitzman_ednref19"
        title=""
><sup>[19]</sup></a
>
    To the left of the broken mast is a fantastical figure in full feather
    headdress carrying a club and skewered human arm—an image in close concert
    with the headdresses of Buti’s natives, and one of few prints during the late
    Cinquecento that features large peacock-like plumes. Markey argues that
    Stradano was responding to imagery and accounts of New World native
    cannibalism and presents this native as a proud but demonic fantasy.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn20"
        name="_weitzman_ednref20"
        title=""
><sup>[20]</sup></a
>
    Vespucci was a crucial figure for the Medici as secretary on a diplomatic
    mission to France, and later Spain. He represented Florence in New World
    expeditions, which was important to the Medici’s political prowess as they
    were not active participants in these voyages. The fixation on Vespucci and
    his alignment with the discovery of the New World is still evident in the
    creation of images like Stradano’s, and indicates a pervasive ideological
    attachment to his conquests.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn21"
        name="_weitzman_ednref21"
        title=""
><sup>[21]</sup></a
>
</p>
<p>
    The full-plumed headdresses on Buti’s natives could be a quotation of
    Stradano’s allegory given their visual congruence, but, in turn, also a
    reference to Vespucci’s textual accounts of America. Vespucci embarked on four
    expeditions along the coasts of modern Brazil and Venezuela which he referred
    to in earlier letters as the “the south of Asia,” and in a second letter
    vaguely described a single land mass that was “not Asia.”<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn22"
        name="_weitzman_ednref22"
        title=""
><sup>[22]</sup></a
>
    In Vespucci’s correspondence to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de’ Medici and
    Florentine statesman Piero Soderini, he refers repeatedly to the natives they
    encountered as nude and cannibalistic, white or red in complexion, and some
    bearing round shields, spears, and bows and arrows.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn23"
        name="_weitzman_ednref23"
        title=""
><sup>[23]</sup></a
>
    Buti includes natives with variant complexions who carry spears and shields in
    the Spanish battle scene, and the plethora of parrots in the tracery also
    echoes Vespucci’s accounts of the variety of colorful birds he encountered.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn24"

        title=""
><sup>[24]</sup></a
>
    (On parrots, <a href="#lipsman-parrots">see the entry by Claire Lipsman</a>)
    As Vespucci sailed far south along the coast of what is known as South America
    in search of gold, it is clear from his letters that he became more convinced
    they had embarked on new land rather than a continuation of the Asian
    continent.<a href="#_weitzman_edn25" name="_weitzman_ednref25" title=""
><sup>[25]</sup></a
>
    His reports hinted at the possibility that Columbus’s Asiatic landmass was
    surrounded by two oceans—an inference which later became the first
    cartographic reference to the Pacific Ocean depicted by
    <a name="_Hlk532114433">Martin Waldseemüller</a> (<i>figure 10</i>).<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn26"
        name="_weitzman_ednref26"
        title=""
><sup>[26]</sup></a
>
    At the suggestion of Waldseemüller, the region was christened with Amerigo
    Vespucci’s namesake, which had deep connections to Florence, the Medici, and
    their court.<a href="#_weitzman_edn27" name="_weitzman_ednref27" title=""
><sup>[27]</sup></a
>
    Coupled with Vespucci’s accounts, Stradano’s imagery and his ties to the court
    allowed the Medici some authorship in the phenomenon of the New World. In this
    respect, Stradano’s imagery carries particular resonance in the midst of
    hundreds of allegorical prints circulating during the period.
</p>
<p>
    Although Waldseemüller’s c.1507 map demonstrates that Vespucci’s descriptions
    marked the beginning of a shift in the way the Americas were depicted as
    cartographically separate from Asia, it is not proof that the Medici’s own
    conceptualization of the Americas changed as quickly. Rather, while Brazilian
    iconography prevails in Buti’s Amerindian imagery as demonstrated by his
    quotation of Weiditz, as well as visual connections to Stradano’s courtly work
    and Vespucci’s Florentine legacy, Asian references in Ludovico Buti’s imagery
    are equally prevalent and significant. One probable connection to the Asian
    continent in Ludovico Buti’s armory ceiling is the convincingly rendered
    rhinoceros below the battle scene between New World natives and Spanish
    conquistadors (<i>figure 11</i>). The inclusion of the rhinoceros is not
    perfunctory. Buti also positions two elephants below the opposite Medici
    scene; because the Turks often used elephants in battle, the iconography is
    fitting in this particular context.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn28"
        name="_weitzman_ednref28"
        title=""
><sup>[28]</sup></a
>
    With a clear cultural conjunction in the elephants, one can infer that the
    rhinoceros carries a similar signification.
</p>
<p>
    The rhinoceros also appears in Francesco I de Medici’s sixteenth-century
    fabricated grotto in the Garden of Castello at the outskirts of Florence (<i
>figure 12</i
>). The menagerie of 36 animals include, among others, native European fauna:
    an Indian elephant, rhinoceros, and goat, an African lion, giraffe, and camel,
    and a New World turkey—referred to as <i>gallina d’ India </i>in inventories
    and the larger courtly milieu in Rome and Florence, and often equated with the
    peacock (which could explain Stradano’s peacock plumes on his allegory of
    America).<a href="#_weitzman_edn29" name="_weitzman_ednref29" title=""
><sup>[29]</sup></a
>
    This composite reflects a similar approach to both Buti’s imagery and Medici
    cataloging of precious objects. This conflation of culture is mirrored by the
    liberal nature of cataloging by terminology and categorization in Medici
    inventories c.1539 and 1564, which classified objects by type, such as
    weapons, costumes, animals, and masks, rather than separating them by
    geographic region.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn30"
        name="_weitzman_ednref30"
        title=""
><sup>[30]</sup></a
>
    Further, according to Claudia Lazzaro, the Indian rhinoceros was rarely seen
    in person, but Albrecht Durer’s 1515 print (<i>figure 13</i>) made wide
    circulation and was most likely the model for the grotto.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn31"
        name="_weitzman_ednref31"
        title=""
><sup>[31]</sup></a
>
    It is possible that the print stood in for Buti’s rendering as well, forming a
    clear association with India. Thus, the rhinoceros in its clear connection to
    the grotto, and the elephants and their connection to the Turks, form a
    central line across the fresco that represents not only conquest but a New
    World that overlaps with Indian cultural signifiers.
</p>
<p>
    Imagery tied to India featuring New World natives was also present in
    circulating prints and atlases during Buti’s period. German painter and
    printmaker Hans Burgkmair’s c.1526 print series
    <i>People of Calicut: The Triumphal Procession of Emperor Maximilian I </i>(<i
>figures 14, 15, 16</i
>) features an interwoven group of disparate figures. The leader wears a
    turban and rides an elephant, followed by a processional of figures in New
    World feather headdresses and skirts marching with an array of animals, and
    carrying another leader on a bier with a parasol.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn32"
        name="_weitzman_ednref32"
        title=""
><sup>[32]</sup></a
>
    Buti’s <i>tondo </i>is a similar parade. William Sturtevant notes that the
    <i>Calicut </i>print’s details were derived from accounts of Balthasar
    Springer’s c. 1505-6 travels to India.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn33"
        name="_weitzman_ednref33"
        title=""
><sup>[33]</sup></a
>
    Peter Mason argues that Burgkmair’s <i>Calicut </i>prints contain both
    American and Indian imagery—a detail that both mimics Buti’s cross-cultural
    depictions in the armory and reveals that one cannot attribute all featherwork
    to American natives.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn34"
        name="_weitzman_ednref34"
        title=""
><sup>[34]</sup></a
>
    In grouping these seemingly disparate figures together in one procession,
    Burgkmair inextricably links their geographic proximity. Burgkmair’s
    processional demonstrates a commixing of cultures present in all four of
    Buti’s battle scenes and central <i>tondo</i>—turbaned Turks, feathered
    American natives, and an assembly of Asian and Indian animals—while collecting
    them under the canopy of “Calicut.” Georg Braun and Franz Hogenberg’s c. 1572
    colored print of the shores of Calicut in the widely circulated atlas of
    cities <i>Civitates Orbis Terrarum </i>(<i>figures 17, 18</i>) also shares
    pictorial congruence with Buti’s <i>tondo </i>scene.
    <i>Zamorin of Calicut</i> depicts a sprawling coast filled with ships, their
    course of travel ambiguous, and natives parading on the sand with a parasol
    and their emperor on a bier—similar to Buti’s parade of Amerindians in their
    costume, weaponry, and classicized gait, as well as his native with the
    rhinoceros, who wears a comparable headdress with a tail of hair whipping in
    the wind. To the far right are two fat elephants roaming inland. That a
    feathered native and chief on a bier can be considered both from America and
    Calicut/India, and elephants can be Turkish or Indian demonstrates the looser
    visual demarcation regarding the New World as a geographic place still
    prevalent in Buti’s period and fully adopted into Medici visual culture.
</p>
<p>
    That Burgkmair and Braun/Hogenberg’s depictions of Calicutians use similar
    iconographic tropes presented in Buti’s American natives could indicate
    confusion, a conflation of “foreign,” “exotic,” “Indian,” or “New World”
    things. By borrowing from multiple circulating prints and codices, Buti
    created adulterated images in the armory that likely seemed familiar to the
    viewer but lacked specificity. Evidence that the Medici were slower to let go
    of cultural consolidation and references to the Indies is also present in
    contemporary maps that were important cultural artifacts. The Guardaroba (<i
>figure 19</i
>) was another colossal project spearheaded by the Medici family meant to
    bring order to their collection of transcontinental objects through organizing
    objects by region, but was never fully realized. Unlike the typical

    fifty-three maps were painted by Egnazio Danti and Stefano Buonsignori on
    large cabinet doors that were to house hundreds of objects corresponding to
    each map’s location. Completed in 1586, the project marked a paradigm shift in
    mapmaking during the period. The maps were rooted in Ptolemaic tradition but
    updated to reflect discoveries and fluctuating understanding of landmasses.<a

    The inventory and contents of the Guardaroba cabinets are an unresolved
    problem, complicating our contemporary understanding of how the Medici viewed
    the world. However, much like Buti, we know Egnazio Danti sourced multiple
    prints, manuscripts, nautical charts, and travelers’ reports to accurately
    portray each region.<a

        name="_weitzman_ednref37"
        title=""

    For our purposes, the Guardaroba’s significance lies in the fact that it is
    extant proof the Medici understood Africa, Asia, and America as separate
    landmasses. But the maps are rooted in, and indeed surpass, the ancient
    Ptolemaic tradition which was tied to their humanist and erudite culture,<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn38"
        name="_weitzman_ednref38"
        title=""

    and was also of crucial importance to Vespucci—evident through Vespucci’s
    reference to Ptolemaic maps in his early letters.<a

        name="_weitzman_ednref39"
        title=""

</p>
<p>
    We also know that Danti consulted Abraham Ortelius’s c.1570 world map from the
    <i>Theatrum Orbis Terrarum </i>(<i>figure 20</i>), which was widely known in
    the Medici court.<a href="#_weitzman_edn40" name="_weitzman_ednref40" title=""
><sup>[40]</sup></a
>
    It is through Ortelius that we can gain some purchase on one way the Medici
    might have conceptualized the New World: while originating from separate
    landmasses, there is an indelible intimacy between Southeast Asia, India, and
    the Americas. Ortelius’s world map has a clear demarcation of the continents;
    however, New Guinea is positioned in close proximity to the Americas, which
    physically situates the New World to the east, rather than the west. If the
    map were connected at either side to form a globe, the Americas would nearly
    touch Cathay. (On Cathay, Tangut, and Mangi on sixteenth-century maps,
    <a href="#wu-tangut-cathay-mangi">see the essay by Peiyue Wu</a>.) Within the
    <i>Theatrum Orbis Terrarum </i>there is also a detailed map of the Pacific (<i
>figure 21</i
>), the first of its kind. The Americas are positioned in close proximity to
    China, New Guinea, and Japan, leaving a Pacific Ocean that is smaller than how
    we understand it today, underscoring the probability that the Medici and their
    contemporaries did not completely divorce the Americas from the East.
</p>
<p>
    Ortelius’s <i>Indiae Orientalis, </i>in the same atlas, (<i>figure 22</i>)<i
> </i>reveals similar information to his map of the Pacific. India and
    Southeast Asia are presented as a landmass without boundaries, in close
    proximity to Japan, Papua New Guinea, and the Americas. The American continent
    is labelled in Latin as <i>Americae Siue Indiae</i><i>—</i>“America or India.”
    The intimacy of the Americas and the East and its textual connection to India
    mirrors Ludovico Buti’s seemingly appropriative armory ceiling, and in this
    respect qualifies the logic in commingling Indian signifiers with Brazil and
    Aztec in sixteenth-century pictorial representations. German cartographer
    Caspar Vopel’s c.1545 map
    <i
    >Nova Et Integra Vniversaliqve Orbis Totivs IVXTA Germanvm Neotericovm
        Traditionem Descriptio</i
    >
    (copied in Venice c.1558) also joins New Spain with Asia. The Harvard c.1558
    copy by Vavassore is divided into 12 prints that make up a map of the world.
    In the top left section, <i>India Orientalis </i>is merged with
    <i>Asia Magna, Messigo, </i>and <i>Hispania. </i>In the neighboring section to
    the right, <i>Asia Orientalis </i>is just above <i>Hispania Major</i>. Further
    down the map in what appears to be modern Mexico or South America is
    <i>America Nova Orbis Pars </i>(<i>figures 23, 24, 25, 26</i>)<i>.</i>
</p>
<p>
    While Vopel’s map did not originate in Italy, Florence was not divorced from
    the culture from which it emerged; as demonstrated, prints from Germany,
    Antwerp, and across Europe played some role in developing the courtly
    worldview of an America conjoined with, or closely related to, Asia.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn41"
        name="_weitzman_ednref41"
        title=""
><sup>[41]</sup></a
>
    With this in mind, it is likely the Medici and their artists understood the
    New World and its natives to be of the East and aligned more closely
    ideologically with the expansive India Orient that in the Ptolemaic tradition
    lies “beyond the Ganges,” or as Columbus described during his second voyage in
    1494, Alpha-Omega, where east meets west.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn42"
        name="_weitzman_ednref42"
        title=""
><sup>[42]</sup></a

    This general perception was in flux, as some maps were reformulated to reflect
    newly discovered landmasses, while goods—even people—arrived in Florence
    through Medici connections and gift exchange.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn43"

    In painting the armory ceiling to supplement the weapons on display, Ludovico
    Buti was responding to the New World context as framed by Medici court
    culture.
</p>
<p>
    As Eviatar Zerubavel argues, Vespucci was one of few pundits who set the
    precedent for the intellectual shift of imagining and depicting the New World
    as a separate landmass from Asia.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn44"
        name="_weitzman_ednref44"
        title=""
><sup>[44]</sup></a
>
    Why, then, did the Medici continue to reference imagery that continued to
    conflate the two continents, in turn depicting an ambiguous amalgam of
    cultures on the armory ceiling? Due to the ubiquitous nature of these widely
    known prints disseminated within the court, narrative and ethnographic
    pictorial representations were slower to follow suit. The Medici embraced
    these anachronistic tendencies by using them as references in their imagery.
    Even maps such as those contained in Ortelius’s atlas that separated the
    continents weren’t entirely confident that America wasn’t part of Asia.
    Further, the Medici family’s liberal practice of categorizing objects, coupled
    with the fluid definition of the word “Indian,” helped build an environment in
    which projection of the New World mirrored the Old, lightly grasping at
    Ptolemaic tradition. Thus, the idea of a continent of America untouched by
    Asia was slow to formulate even in Medici Florence where Vespucci carried a
    legacy. The armory was a commission by a powerful Ducal family in the midst of
    establishing its identity not only among dignitaries from Spain and Portugal
    who had a hand in New World exploration, but also within a shifting worldview
    that required revisions of its classical antecedent.<a
        href="#_weitzman_edn45"
        name="_weitzman_ednref45"
        title=""
><sup>[45]</sup></a
>
    The result is a representation of a New World that is not completely divorced
    from Asia, situated in a court culture that was simultaneously well aware of
    Vespucci’s innovative observations of a separate New World. Thus the fresco is
    an example of a hyper-local, as well as larger, continental identity in flux—a
    process of reconciliation of the anachronistic Ptolemaic ancient practice and
    development of an understanding of a brand-new, largely unknown society across
    the Atlantic. The Medici were working through what Zerubavel calls “denial”–
    “a way of resisting the unfamiliar by forcing it into familiar mental niches,
    thereby practically denying its novelty or unusualness.”<sup> </sup

    A dichotomy existed between Francesco’s desire to have agency in the discovery
    of the New World and its profound implications on the early modern world. In
    step with the loose categorization of Medici objects, appropriation of
    multifarious New World prints and texts circulating throughout Europe, and the
    atlases that situated the American landmass in the East, Ferdinando projected
    an image of Amerasia on the armory ceiling that the Medici court would have
    expected to see.

        Lia Markey titles this scene after the battle of Poimbino, which is a
        plausible hypothesis. Cosimo I de’Medici occupied Piombino, and in 1553 and
        1555 the port was attacked by a French-Ottoman fleet. The harbor could
        represent not only the wealth and good exchange within the Medici social
        circle, but also triumph in battle and desires to explore beyond its shores.
        Markey also notes that portraying the battle was a tradition in the Medici
        court.

        While not all of the standards are easily decipherable, their the red,
        white, and gold color scheme evoke both the colors of the Lorraine family
        coat of arms and the Spanish flag. The flags bearing white and red crosses
        could also be British crusader flags, or represent the Holy Roman Empire.
        While these claims are also hypothetical, further research of the standards
        clearly visible in the battle scenes warrant further research as a
        definitive answer could lead to a greater understanding of the political
        motives underlying the commission of the armory ceiling.

        The bananas hanging prominently from the palm tree in the central
        <i>tondo </i>carry connotations of both India and Africa—Pliny the Elder
        described the banana as eaten by the sages of India, and the fruit was
        introduced to the Americas by the Portuguese via the Canary Islands, and
        through missionaries who planted them in Mexico and the Island of Hispanola
        (now modern Haiti and Dominican Republic) in the sixteenth century. There is
        no evidence that bananas existed in the Americas beforehand, and their
        inclusion in the central <i>tondo</i> not only represents the entire
        American continent, but also alludes to the presence of early European
        conquistadors; Virginia Scott Jenkins,

        Markey also notes Father Giovanni Petro Maffei’s c.1588 manuscript
        <i>History of the Indies</i> 1588 as a source for Stradano, which outlines
        conversion of natives in India and the New World; Ibid., 398-99, 420.

        For greater exposition on Stradano’s amalgamation of New World objects and
        sources see Lia Markey, “Stradano’s Allegorical Invention.” There is a wide
        range of prints and paintings of continental allegories from the sixteenth
        and seventeenth centuries that fed into the broad culture of the New World.
        Examing the scope and influence of the continental allegories on Buti and
        New World imagery is out of scope for this project. For a history of the
        allegories of the continents, see Peiyue Wu’s entry.

        In her dissertation <i>The New World in Renaissance Italy,</i> Lia Markey
        clearly outlines the importance of distinguishing Medici collections from
        other collections in Europe as each region approached their objects
        differently. See also Adrianna Turpin for a precise examination of the
        collecting differences between the Habsburgs and Medici.

        Ferdinando’s interests in the New World continued to the end of his life. In
        1608, he dispatched English Captain Robert Thornton to northern Brazil to
        establish a settlement. Thornton returned in 1609 with six natives, five of
        whom unfortunately died of small pox within days of their arrival. One lived
        in Tuscany thereafter, learning the Tuscan language. Fernando never saw the
        fruits of his labor in this conquest as he died before Thornton could
        return. For an account of the impact of this exposition, see Vittoria
        Riccio’s entry.
