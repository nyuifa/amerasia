<h1>Zaphala</h1>

<p>
    Next to an elephant in southern Africa, Vopel writes, “All of India and Persia
    drink their fill of gold from the people of Zaphala” (<em
>Tota India et Persis/ ex Zaphalasuum/ hau[r/s]it aurum</em
>), referring to Sofala in present-day Mozambique, found not far from this
    inscription on the Vopel map. The Portuguese reached Sofala during the first
    voyage of Vasco da Gama. Drawing on a letter dated June 28, 1501 from Giovanni
    Maria Cretico, a Venetian diplomat in Portugal, the Italian geographer
    Fracanzo da Montalboddo noted Zaffala as the site of a miraculous goldmine;
    leaving Africa from this coast and sailing East, Cretico reported that ships
    would next arrive in India.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> In his
    1537 <em>Novis orbis</em>, the German mathematician and geographer Simon
    Grynaeus similarly described Zaphala as facing east on the coast of Africa, so
    that if one crossed the Indian Ocean from there, in sixty leagues, they would
    arrive in Calicut.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a> Tomé Lopes, Vasco
    da Gama’s companion, identified it with Ophir, an identification that lived on
    in Milton’s <em>Paradise Lost</em> (11:399-401) (link to <a href="#riccio-ophir">Ophir entry</a>). Sofala
    became the center of the sub-Saharan gold trade in the Renaissance.

<p>
    From the very beginning, therefore, all European seaborne traffic to India
    unfolded along the African coast, pulling Africa into a geographic and
    commercial relationship with India. The administrative affairs of Portuguese
    trade with Africa were managed by the <em>Casa da Guiné</em>, which was
    renamed <em>Casa da India e da Guiné</em> (often shortened to
    <em>Casa da India</em>) after the circumnavigation of Africa by Vasco da Gama
    in 1497 established a sea route to India. Ships returning to Lisbon were
    filled with items from a variety of ports in the Portuguese-controlled world,
    yet the goods unloaded there and sent on for sale throughout Europe were
    registered as having arrived from the <em>Estado da Índia</em>, a general
    identifier that very likely colored their provenance from then onward.<a

    In all of these ways, beginning with the Portuguese voyages from Africa to
    India, Africa became strongly connected to India, and in turn, incorporated
    into ideas about the Indies and Amerasia.
