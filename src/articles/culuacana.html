<h1>Culuacana</h1>

<p>
    Acolhuacan was a pre-Columbian province to the east of Tenochtitlan, yet for
    the early European explorers its position in the world was quite different
    than for the indigenous communities. Vopel tells us a bit about this region in
    the cartouche to the east of this region, which begins “Narat Petrus Martir…”
    (link to <a href="#cartouche-america-connected">Cartouche: America connected to the eastern lands</a>), saying that
    “America itself is connected to the eastern lands and to Acolhuacan
    (<em>Coluacanae</em>). Vopel’s language here, as elsewhere, is drawn verbatim
    from the Belgian cartographer and globe-maker Franciscus Monachus, whose
    <em>De orbis situ ac descriptione</em> (<em
>The Position and Description of the World</em
>) (Antwerp, 1527). In his treatise, Monachus claimed that “in the writings of
    Ferdinand [Cortés], the <em>Culva</em> or <em>Culvacana</em> of Hernando
    [Cortés] is the province in which is situated the residence of the Emperor of
    the East; elsewhere in accounts of voyages it is Cataya.”<a

    Culiacán or Culuacan, that is, used to be known as an eastern extreme of
    Cathay (see <a href="#chatay">entry for Chatay</a> and <a href="#wu-tangut-cathay-mangi">essay by Wu on Tangut,
    Cathay, and Mangi</a>). For both Monachus and Vopel, understanding the
    overlap between Asia and America that was revealed by early modern explorers
    required renaming old Asian places with new American names.
