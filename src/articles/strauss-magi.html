<h1>
    Looking Westward from Tharssis: Representing the Adoration of the Magi after
    1492
</h1>
<h2>Scarlett H. Strauss</h2>
<p>
    Far to the east on the Vopel Map lies the city of Tharssis, which Vopel labels
    as the kingdom from which the Magus Melchior traveled to worship the infant
    Christ. <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> Along with Ophir,
    Tharssis appears in the Hebrew Bible as a source of wealth.
    <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> (link to Ophir entry) By the
    Middle Ages, Pierre DÕAilly situated Tharssis on the western border of Cathay,
    and Columbus later associated it with the island of Hispaniola.
    <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> (link to Hispaniola entry)
</p>
<p>
    From this far-eastern kingdom, Melchior would have traveled directly westward
    to the Holy Land, which lies at almost exactly the same latitude on VopelÕs
    map. <a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4] </a> This directional
    journey is theologically significant: in the Gospel of Matthew, the only
    biblical source to mention the Magi, the kings are described as coming
    <i>Òab oriente,Ó </i> from the East.
    <a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a> Subsequent authors
    elaborated on this story of Eastern rulers bearing gifts, identifying three
    kings who represent the three ages of man, commonly named Balthasar, Melchior,
    and Caspar. <a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> The Magi provide
    a particularly useful case study to consider an Amerasian worldview.
</p>
<p>
    As outsiders to the Judeo-Christian tradition, the Magi and their worship
    served to legitimate ChristÕs importance.
    <a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""> [7] </a> They were also useful
    models for European monarchs: rulers substituted their own likeness for one of
    the Three Kings in paintings of the Nativity, or performed as Magi during
    coronation ceremonies as a means of justifying their power.
    <a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8] </a> Although foreignness is a
    crucial feature of the Magi, the visualization of their cultural and
    geographic otherness in artistic representations varied throughout the early
    modern period. By the 15th century, one of the kings was frequently shown as
    African, and as Europeans continued to explore the larger world, images of the
    Magi reveal shifting ideas of time and place.
    <a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a> As the first gentiles to
    worship Christ, the Magi are not only precursors to European Christians, but
    also potential models for non-European converts to Christianity.
</p>
<p>
    Visual representations of the Magi provide a valuable lens for considering how
    early modern artists and viewers might have understood the changing geography
    of the world around them. This essay begins from a self-consciously modern
    perspective of what constitutes an ÒAmericanÓ magus, progressively expanding
    this category to consider images which early modern viewers might have
    understood as ÒAmerasian.Ó By beginning from a modern worldview and
    systematically shifting its parameters, it is possible to explore the varied
    and flexible ways in which American iconography is incorporated with other
    geographic references, and thus consider the range of ways in which early
    modern Europeans might have understood the Magi in relation to the New World.
</p>
<p>
    An early sixteenth-century <i>Adoration of the Magi</i> attributed to Vasco
    Fernandes (Figure 1) is the touchstone of scholarly discussions about an
    American Magus. The figures crowd in the foreground: the Madonna sits with the
    Christ Child on her lap behind a low parapet, and the three Magi approach her
    from the left. The eldest king kneels with his hat off and his hands clasped
    in prayer; he has already given his gift, which the Virgin now passes to
    Joseph. Behind him stand the other two Magi, one removing his hat in
    reverence, the other striding forward and holding out his gift. It is this
    third Magus who has captured scholarly attention. His feather headdress and
    the arrow he holds have been convincingly identified with the Tupinamba people
    of Brazil, first encountered by the Portuguese explorer Pedro Alvares Cabral
    in 1500, shortly before the date of FernandesÕ painting.
    <a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""> [10] </a>
</p>
<p>
    Joseph Koerner and others have noted that this connection to Portuguese
    exploration is crucial for understanding the painting and its inclusion of an
    American Magus. Indeed, FernandesÕ painting was part of an altar retable for
    the cathedral of Viseu, CabralÕs hometown, and the third kingÕs telltale
    iconography&#8212;the headdress with colorful parrot feathers&#8212;stems
    directly from accounts of the people encountered on this voyage.
    <a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11] </a> Yet the figure is
    clothed, in a striking departure from the European descriptions of naked
    natives they had encountered in the New World. This has previously been
    explained in terms of theological necessity, in that it would breach all rules
    of decorum to show a nude Magus.
    <a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""> [12] </a> Koerner goes further,
    arguing also that clothing served also as a means of ÒtamingÓ the figure, much
    as Cabral attempted to do by introducing some of the Tupinamba he encountered
    to European customs. <a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13] </a>
</p>
<p>
    In an attempt to step outside of this unidirectional model of European
    hegemony attempting to ÒcivilizeÓ the Tupinamba, it is worth considering the
    ways in which foreignness and familiarity are productively held in tension.
    The fundamental difference of the Tupinamba MagusÕs featherwork keeps him from
    being wholly assimilated, but the addition of clothing resembling a doublet
    and knee breeches allows him to enter into European representational
    conventions rather than being just an exotic Òother.Ó
    <a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""> [14] </a> These two systems of
    clothing (and of cultural coding) are in fact melded, rather than simply being
    overlaid: the Tupinamba feathers are intermingled with the figureÕs
    Europeanizing clothing, incorporated around the edges of the figureÕs doublet.
    <a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15] </a> The Tupinamba Magus
    strides into representation and recognizability, his Europeanized garb
    bringing him just close enough to a Portuguese visual language for his
    foreignness to be comprehensible.
</p>
<p>
    CabralÕs voyage to Brazil also opens geographic&#8212;as well as
    cultural&#8212;questions. His landfall in Brazil was accidental: he intended
    to sail around the Cape of Good Hope to reach India, but went off course in
    the tropics, resulting in his brief sojourn in Brazil before returning across
    the Atlantic to complete his original voyage.<a
        href="#_edn16"
        name="_ednref16"
        title=""
>[16]
</a>
    While to modern viewers, Brazil and West Africa are two fundamentally
    different locations separated by the Atlantic Ocean, early 16th century
    navigators did not yet have a means of calculating longitude. Instead, they
    divided the world latitudinally into polar zones, temperate zones, and
    tropical zones.<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17] </a> For
    Cabral&#8212;and for Fernandes&#8212;it would be logical to draw parallels
    between different peoples living in the tropics. Indeed, Fernandes depicts the
    third Magus with some of the features common to African figures: his short
    textured hair and his dark skin, as well as his earring and jewelry, could
    also be associated with Africa.<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">
    [18]
</a>
    Additionally, rather than including both an African Magus and a New World
    Magus, the Tupinamba figure supplants his African predecessor. Here, then,
    similitude is sufficient to justify substitution.
</p>
<p>
    It is also worth considering how replacing an African Magus&#8212;who by this
    point had become a staple of Magian imagery&#8212;with a New World Magus
    reshapes the understanding of the Three Kings arriving Òab oriente,Ó from the
    east. For Fernandes, working in Portugal, much of Africa was to the east, and
    yet Portuguese explorers reached Africa by sailing south. Relative to
    Bethlehem, where the nativity of Christ occurred, most of Africa is south and
    west. Though the Horn of Africa extends further east than the Holy Land,
    traveling from East Africa to Bethlehem would still predominantly be a
    northward journey. Prester John&#8212;understood as a descendant of one of the
    Magi&#8212;was often situated in East Africa, but on the Vopel Map at least he
    appears in Abassia, directly south of the Holy Land.<a
        href="#_edn19"
        name="_ednref19"
        title=""
>[19]
</a>
    [<a href="#pivar-presterjohn">See the essay on Prester John by Larimore Pivar</a>] An African Magus, then, is
    difficult to comprehend as coming from the east, which perhaps enables this
    figure to be replaced in the Viseu altarpiece with an American Magus, who
    similarly complicates a directional understanding of the Magi.
</p>
<p>
    An Amerasian worldview, particularly at the beginning of the 16th century,
    could sustain the possibility that Brazil marked a point at which east and
    west meet. If New World was understood as being connected to East Asia&#8212;a
    worldview that is wholly supported by the Vopel Map&#8212;it is possible that
    a Magus from Brazil could have made an immensely long land journey across the
    New World and Asia to reach Bethlehem.<a
        href="#_edn20"
        name="_ednref20"
        title=""
>[20]
</a>
    From a European vantage point, however, people in the New World were reached
    by traveling west, not east&#8212;a distinction which is particularly
    important for the Portuguese and Spanish, who used this directional model to
    determine their mercantile and colonial powers over any lands discovered by
    sea.<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[21] </a> Two-dimensional
    cartographic representations also echo this directionality: although a land
    voyage would be possible given the geographic configuration of the Vopel Map,
    its organization of the world onto a flat plane nonetheless situates Brazil to
    the west of Jerusalem. The Cantino Planisphere (<a
        href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Cantino_planisphere_%281502%29.jpg"
>here</a
>), created just after CabralÕs voyage and reflecting his new discoveries,
    also situates Brazil to the west. In this representation, the western end of
    Brazil is left undetermined, and it is uncertain whether a land route
    traveling westward would even be possible.
</p>
<p>
    An anonymous Bolognese painting of the <i>Adoration of the Magi</i> (<a
        href="http://catalogo.fondazionezeri.unibo.it/scheda.v2.jsp?locale=en&amp;decorator=layout_resp&amp;apply=true&amp;tipo_scheda=F&amp;id=83108&amp;titolo=Anonimo+-+Anonimo+bolognese+-+sec.+XVI+-+Adorazione+dei+Re+Magi+-+insieme"
        target="_blank">here</a
>), dating to the mid to late 16th century, again implies an Amerasian
    worldview in which someone from the New World could have traveled to see the
    infant Christ. Here, however, the figure in question is not one of the three
    kings presenting their gifts before the Madonna and Child in the center
    foreground (<a
        href="http://catalogo.fondazionezeri.unibo.it/scheda.v2.jsp?locale=en&amp;decorator=layout_resp&amp;apply=true&amp;tipo_scheda=F&amp;id=83111&amp;titolo=Anonimo+-+Anonimo+bolognese+-+sec.+XVI+-+Adorazione+dei+Re+Magi+-+particolare"
        target="_blank">here</a
>). These kings reveal a range of skin tones and geographical markers, and can
    plausibly be identified as a kneeling East Asian king who gazes up at the
    Christ Child who blesses him, a dark-skinned African king with a turban, and
    another turbaned king with a beard who is likely Near Eastern.
    <a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title=""> [22] </a>
</p>
<p>
    One of the figures in the midground at the left of the panel (<a
        href="http://catalogo.fondazionezeri.unibo.it/scheda.v2.jsp?locale=en&amp;decorator=layout_resp&amp;apply=true&amp;tipo_scheda=F&amp;id=83110&amp;titolo=Anonimo+-+Anonimo+bolognese+-+sec.+XVI+-+Corteo+dei+Re+Magi+-+particolare"
        target="_blank">here</a
>), however, appears to be wearing a feathered headdress and other feathered
    decoration around his neck, attire which strikingly resembles the woodcut
    images of cannibals made to illustrate an account of the discoveries of
    Amerigo Vespucci (Figure 2). Though it is currently impossible to identify the
    animal he is riding, the figure holds a heraldic trumpet, suggesting that he
    is a part of the entourage of one of the three kings. This seems to support
    the belief that the people of the New World were, in fact, inhabitants of
    Asia. The feathered figure here, then, must be understood as both a figure
    from the New World and the subject of an East Asian monarch. While to modern
    eyes, this appears to be an erroneous conflation of America and Asia,
    understanding the painting on its own historical terms allows both of these
    identities to coexist within the same figure. As the Vopel Map attests,
    portions of East Asia known to Marco Polo and the newly discovered New World
    were sufficiently proximate geographically to justify the presence of a New
    World figure in the retinue of a far eastern king.
</p>
<p>
    The other set of Magian images which, to our modern perspective, clearly
    include figures from the New World are paintings created in the Americas.
    Trexler notes that particularly in the Andean region around modern Peru,
    European colonizers of the early 16th century sought for evidence that
    Christianity had already reached the New World in antiquity, including by
    suggesting the possibility of a Native American Magus.
    <a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[23] </a> A 17th century Peruvian
    painting by Diego de la Puente visualizes this possibility, showing one of the
    Magi in the robes and headdress of an Incan king (<a
        href="https://preview.redd.it/kvlncjnjql101.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04faf8eac1df70c5d6b0646654e5925f34353f65"
        target="_blank">here</a
>). <a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title=""> [24] </a> Unlike European
    images with New World figures, the inclusion of an Incan Magus here is most
    likely motivated by practical and propagandistic reasons. In the Andes,
    depicting three Magi from the Old World (for instance, an African figure, an
    Ottoman figure, and a Chinese figure) would have been all but unintelligible
    to most non-Europeans. The inclusion of an Incan Magus&#8212;particularly in
    conjunction with an African Magus, who would also represent a potentially
    recognizable physiognomic type, given the rise of trans-Atlantic
    slavery&#8212;makes the painting more accessible and comprehensible to its
    immediate audience. The Incan Magus could also serve as a model for native
    peoples, who could be directed to emulate this painted figure in their own
    devotion to Christ.
</p>
<p>
    The paintings discussed above all contain figures who can be convincingly
    associated with the New World, suggesting that the route of the Magi passed
    through America. Such clear examples, however, are rare. Does this scarcity
    reflect a lack of interest among early modern Europeans in depicting New World
    Magi, or does it reflect the narrowness of our current definition of
    ÒAmericanÓ?
</p>
<p>
    <a>
        An Amerasian worldview could broaden this inquiry to also consider figures
        whose foreignness may include or refer to the New World, but in conjunction
        with areas that we now see as different geographic regions such as India and
        Africa. These images are particularly intriguing because of the flexibility
        of the term ÒIndiaÓ in the early modern period, variously encompassing East
        Africa, areas of South and East Asia, and the West Indies. <a
            href="#riccio-india" target="_blank">[See the essay on India and Indians by Vittoria
        Riccio]</a>
        Figures that appear to modern scholars to contain mixed iconography might have
        been originally intended to represent inhabitants of a greater India. To our
        eyes, the connections between the subsequent images and the New World appear
        more tenuous, but for some early modern viewers this iconography might have
        resonated with imagery from both the Old World and the New.
</p>
<p>
    A particularly rich subject for this avenue of investigation is Francisco de
    HolandaÕs <i> Adoration of the Magi</i> (<a
        href="http://bdh-rd.bne.es/viewer.vm?id=0000137315&amp;page=86"
        target="_blank">here</a
>), from his <i>De aetatibus mundi imagines</i>, a collection of cosmological
    drawings from the Creation to the Apocalypse. The three Magi kneel at the
    right of the page, each modeling a different form of devotion toward the
    seated Virgin and the Child she holds. The foremost Magus presses his hands to
    the ground, his face down; this particular posture of worship, in conjunction
    with the curved sword at his side, may suggest a Near Eastern figure. The
    second Magus, who is also elderly and bearded, bows down much like his
    companion. His hands, however, are clasped in a European gesture of prayer,
    and his face remains turned toward the Madonna and Christ. If the Magus at the
    front appears to visualize an Islamic gesture of prayer, the second Magus is
    more reminiscent of medieval and Byzantine donor portraits, in a pose of
    <i>proskynesis</i> or veneration.
</p>
<p>
    Unlike the foremost two Magi, whose very similar physiognomies, clothing, and
    poses offer only a suggestion of their geographic origins, the third Magus
    provides an entire range of potentially locatable iconography. The features of
    this Magus and of his followers&#8212;one depicted frontally, and another
    shown in profile, as though providing a full range of views with which to be
    able to understand these figures&#8212;are similar to those given to African
    Magi, as seen in a painting by DŸrer (<a
        href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_-_L%27Adoration_des_mages.jpg"
        target="_blank">here</a
>). In addition to their prominent jaws and furrowed brows, these figures are
    shown beardless with short curly hair, and they each wear earrings, all
    attributes common to African figures.
</p>
<p>
    The figureÕs bangles and headdress, however, point to very different
    referents. The distinctive two-plume headdress is strikingly similar to one
    worn by a figure on a Sri Lankan casket (<a
        href="https://images.tribuneindia.com/cms/gall_content/2018/2/2018_2$largeimg15_Thursday_2018_223007377gallery.jpg"
        target="_blank">here</a
>), who also wears armbands and bracelets. As this casket was a gift from the
    Sri Lankan ambassador to the Portuguese king, it is possible that Holanda
    could have seen it and used it as a model, retaining just the headband and the
    plumes of the Sri Lankan headdress.
    <a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title=""> [25] </a> Figures with similar
    bangles and headgear are depicted on the Indian subcontinent in the Portuguese
    Miller Atlas, created in 1519 and illustrated by none other than Francisco de
    HolandaÕs father Antonio (<a
        href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b55002605w/f1.item.zoom"
        target="_blank">here</a
>). Another comparison could be made to representations of the Mesoamerican
    ruler Moctezuma II (<a
        href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Houghton_Typ_625.99.800_Istoria_della_conquista_del_Messico_-_Motezuma.jpg"
        target="_blank">here</a
>
    and
    <a
            href="https://www.gettyimages.co.nz/detail/illustration/portrait-of-montezuma-ii-tecnochtitlan-last-king-of-stock-graphic/540779689"
            target="_blank">here</a>), who also wears gold armbands and a headpiece with a plume to either side.
    A typological resemblance between HolandaÕs Magus and the images of Moctezuma
    also extends to clothing: both figures are shown seminude, with only a cloak
    over their shoulders and another garment tied about their waists.
</p>
<p>
    While these references read as fundamentally disparate to modern eyes, a
    16th-century viewer might have understood them all as falling under the
    umbrella of the ÒIndies.Ó A closer understanding of HolandaÕs perception of
    art on global terms may also help in clarify these references. As Alessandra
    Russo argues in a current project on Francisco de Holanda and artistic
    universalism, his commentary in both his <i>Dialogues</i> with Michelangelo
    and in <i>Da Pintura Antigua</i> reveals that he already attempted to theorize
    art as a universal trait of humanity. This sort of thinking allowed him to
    approach Mixtec pottery, for example, and understand it as being comparable to
    ancient Greek pottery&#8212;indeed, to consider the possibility that the New
    World had contact with Greco-Roman antiquity at some point in the past.
    <a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title=""> [26] </a> This particular
    parallel is especially important for the drawing. Unlike the first two Magi,
    who are shown in attitudes of prayer, the third Magus is shown in the act of
    offering his gift: he sets down a vessel before the Virgin and Child, which
    looks strikingly like an ancient Greek shoulder lekythos (<a
        href="https://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/tools/pottery/shapes/lekythos.htm"
        target="_blank">here</a
>). His two compatriots, kneeling behind him, also carry their offerings in
    vessels, though these are more difficult to identify. It is possible that the
    figure on the left may hold a pyxis, and the simpler vessel to the right may
    be a krater, but here the parallels to Greek pottery are less distinct.
</p>
<p>
    These vessels, then, may be a visualization of HolandaÕs concept of universal
    antiquity. While the lekythos seems (at least to modern eyes) clearly
    identifiable as a Greek vase, the other two slip away from recognizable types.
    Perhaps the depiction of these vessels, offered by figures who are clearly
    meant to be foreign&#8212;maybe even coming from as far as the New
    World&#8212;was meant to suggest a universal antiquity, visualized through
    their partial similarity to known Greco-Roman objects. Such an interpretation
    might imply that Holanda saw these objects as evolutionarily linked: at some
    point in the past, such as at the time when the Magi went to worship Christ,
    Greek pottery could have been a universal standard.
</p>
<p>
    It is also important to discuss a final category of images: Magi who are
    depicted using the iconography of African figures, but with the addition of
    feathered headwear. As Peter Mason aptly observes, feathers cannot
    conclusively prove a connection to America, nor can their absence preclude
    such a reference, since they appear both on Amerindian and Asian figures (and,
    one might add, on the hats of European and African figures).
    <a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title=""> [27] </a> Since feather
    decoration extends across our modern geographic categories, images of Magi
    with feathers could provide a useful case study for considering whether an
    Amerasian worldview is in play.
</p>
<p>
    Albrecht DŸrerÕs 1504 painting of the <i>Adoration of the Magi</i> (<a

    In the painting, an African Magus&#8212;recognizable not only because of his
    dark skin, but also marked by his prominent forehead, pronounced jaw, and
    curly hair&#8212;holds an elaborate red hat, decorated with jewels and two
    white feathers. Here, the hat is more prominent than its plumes; the feathers
    are attached to it solely as a decoration, in the fashion of European caps. By
    contrast, in DŸrerÕs 1511 print, the multiple textured feathers are the visual
    focus of the hat held by the African Magus. This figure shares the same high
    forehead, strong jaw, and short curly hair as the painted figure, making him
    recognizably African despite his European garments, replete with slashed
    sleeves. A 17th century painting of the <i>Adoration of the Magi</i> by Juan
    Bautista Maino also includes an African Magus whose headdress is overwhelmed
    by feathers (<a

    African king appears to have a turban wrapped around his head, the white band
    of fabric is fairly narrow, and crowned by brightly-colored feathers, like
    those described by Europeans visiting the New World.<a

    These final examples illustrate the difficulty of finding recognizably
    ÒAmericanÓ figures in early modern depictions of the Magi, and provide a test
    case of how far an Amerasian paradigm can be applied to art. Did early modern
    viewers understand all of these figures&#8212;and perhaps also Magi who we
    today identify as Far Eastern&#8212;as being ÒAmerasian,Ó coming from a place
    where east and west meet? Or, conversely, does the relative scarcity of
    conclusive visual references to the New World suggest that most artists
    understood America as a different location to the west, from which the eastern
    Magi could not have come?
</p>
<p>
    In the absence of clear textual sources from artists or viewers of these
    images, this is impossible to determine&#8212;indeed, both of these worldviews
    were probably sustained simultaneously, as a result of unequal access to new
    geographic information. The four paintings which incontrovertibly reference
    the Americas each come from particular contexts where artists could have
    obtained privileged knowledge of the New World: Fernandes painted in the
    hometown of the Portuguese explorer of Brazil, the Bolognese painting comes
    from the city where Charles V and Clement VII met to discuss the implications
    of European exploration, and the two Peruvian paintings originate in the New
    World itself. Holanda, too, had unique access to information about Portuguese
    travel both eastward and westward. It is possible that for such artists, an
    Amerasian worldview suggested the importance of relating the Magi to the New
    World, while for other artists the Americas did not figure into the story of
    the Magi at all.
</p>
<p>
    Ultimately, these images are most useful for highlighting the complexity of
    early modern depictions of the Magi. They point to the importance of
    reconsidering our own modern geographic categories, so as to begin to
    understand the shifting world that European painting sought to visualize.
