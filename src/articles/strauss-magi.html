<h1>Looking Westward: The Image of the American Magus in the Age of Exploration</h1>
<h2>Scarlett H. Strauss</h2>

<p>Far to the east on the Vopel Map lies the city of Tharssis, labeled as the place from which the Magus Melchior
    traveled to worship the infant Christ. Following the configuration of the Vopel Map, Melchior would have traveled
    directly westward to the Holy Land from his eastern home, which lies at almost exactly the same
    latitude.<a href="#strauss_edn1"
                name="strauss_ednref1"
                title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> This directionality is theologically significant: in the Gospel of Matthew,
    the only biblical source to mention the Magi, the kings are described as coming “ab oriente,” from the
    East.<a href="#strauss_edn2"
            name="strauss_ednref2"
            title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a> Subsequent authors elaborated on this story of Eastern kings bearing gifts,
    identifying three kings who represent the three ages of man, commonly named Balthasar, Melchior, and
    Caspar.<a href="#strauss_edn3"
              name="strauss_ednref3"
              title=""><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p>As outsiders, the worship of the Magi served to legitimate Christ’s importance.<a href="#strauss_edn4"
                                                                                     name="strauss_ednref4"

    were also useful models for European kings, who were often depicted as one of the Magi or who performed as the Magi
    during coronation ceremonies, as a means of justifying their temporal rule.<a href="#strauss_edn5"
                                                                                  name="strauss_ednref5"
                                                                                  title=""><sup>[5]</sup></a> Although
    foreignness is a crucial feature of the Magi, the visualization of their cultural and geographic otherness in
    artistic representations varied throughout the early modern period. By the 15<sup>th</sup> century, one of the kings
    was frequently shown as African, and throughout the Age of Exploration, images of the Magi visualize shifting
    temporal and geographic networks.<a
            href="#strauss_edn6"
            name="strauss_ednref6"
            title=""><sup>[6]</sup></a> As the first gentiles to worship Christ, the Magi are not only precursors to
    European Christians, but also potential models for non-European converts to Christianity. </p>

<p>As these aspects of the Magi have been extensively examined in the recent literature, this essay focuses upon
    representations of the Adoration of the Magi which include visual references to the New World. Collecting these
    images and placing them in dialogue with one another also reveals a spectrum of “Americanness”—rather than seeing a
    binary of images which either do or do not include a New World Magus, it is possible to explore the varied and
    flexible ways in which American iconography is incorporated with other geographic references, and thus explore the
    ways in which early modern artists understood the New World. </p>

<p>The touchstone in scholarly discussions about an American Magus is an <i>Adoration of the Magi</i> attributed to
    Vasco Fernandes (Figure 1). The figures crowd in the foreground: the Madonna sits with the Christ Child on her lap
    behind a low parapet, and the three Magi approach her from the left. The eldest king kneels with his hat off and his
    hands clasped in prayer; he has already given his gift, which the Virgin now passes to Joseph. Behind him stand the
    other two Magi, one removing his hat in reverence, the other striding forward and holding out his gift. It is this
    third Magus who has captured scholarly attention. His feather headdress and the arrow he holds have been
    convincingly identified with the Tupinamba people of Brazil, first encountered by the Portuguese explorer Pedro
    Alvares Cabral in 1500, shortly before the date of Fernandes’ painting.<a href="#strauss_edn7"
                                                                              name="strauss_ednref7"
                                                                              title=""><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p>As Joseph Koerner and others have noted, this connection to Portuguese exploration is crucial for understanding the
    painting and its inclusion of an American Magus. Indeed, Fernandes’ painting was part of an altar retable for the
    cathedral of Viseu, Cabral’s hometown, and the third king’s telltale iconography—the headdress with colorful parrot
    feathers—stems directly from accounts of the people encountered on this voyage.<a href="#strauss_edn8"
                                                                                      name="strauss_ednref8"
                                                                                      title=""><sup>[8]</sup></a> Yet
    the figure is clothed, in a striking departure from the European descriptions of naked natives they had encountered
    in the New World. This has previously been explained in terms of theological necessity, in that it would breach all
    rules of decorum to show a nude Magus.<a href="#strauss_edn9"
                                             name="strauss_ednref9"
                                             title=""><sup>[9]</sup></a> Koerner goes further, arguing also that
    clothing served also as a means of “taming” the figure, much as Cabral attempted to do by introducing some of the
    Tupinamba he encountered to European customs.<a href="#strauss_edn10"
                                                    name="strauss_ednref10"
                                                    title=""><sup>[10]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>In an attempt to step outside of this unidirectional model of European hegemony attempting to “civilize” the
    Tupinamba, it is worth considering the ways in which foreignness and familiarity are productively held in tension.
    The fundamental difference of the Tupinamba Magus’s featherwork keeps him from being wholly assimilated, but the
    addition of clothing resembling a doublet and knee breeches allows him to enter into European representational
    conventions rather than being just an exotic “other.”<a href="#strauss_edn11"
                                                            name="strauss_ednref11"
                                                            title=""><sup>[11]</sup></a> These two systems of clothing
    (and of cultural coding) are in fact melded, rather than simply being overlaid: the Tupinamba feathers are
    intermingled with the figure’s Europeanizing clothing, incorporated around the edges of the figure’s
    doublet.<a href="#strauss_edn12"
               name="strauss_ednref12"
               title=""><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p>Cabral’s voyage to Brazil also opens geographic—as well as cultural—questions. His landfall in Brazil was accidental:
    he intended to sail around the Cape of Good Hope to reach India, but went off course in the tropics, resulting in
    his brief sojourn in Brazil before returning across the Atlantic to complete his original voyage.<a
            href="#strauss_edn13"
            name="strauss_ednref13"
            title=""><sup>[13]</sup></a> While to modern viewers, Brazil and West Africa are two fundamentally different
    locations separated by the Atlantic Ocean, early 16<sup>th</sup> century navigators did not yet have a means of
    calculating longitude, and instead generally understood the world in terms of latitudinal zones: polar zones,
    temperate zones, and tropical zones.<a href="#strauss_edn14"
                                           name="strauss_ednref14"
                                           title=""><sup>[14]</sup></a> For Cabral—and for Fernandes—it would be logical
    to consider the similarities between different peoples living in the tropics. Indeed, Fernandes depicts the third
    Magus with some of the same features common to African figures: his short textured hair and his dark skin, as well
    as his earring and jewelry, could also be associated with Africa.<a href="#strauss_edn15"
                                                                        name="strauss_ednref15"
                                                                        title=""><sup>[15]</sup></a> Additionally,
    rather than including both an African Magus and a New World Magus, the Tupinamba figure supplants his African
    predecessor. Here, then, similitude is sufficient to justify substitution. </p>

<p>It is also worth considering how replacing an African Magus—who by this point had become a staple of Magian
    imagery—with a New World Magus reshapes the understanding of the Three Kings arriving “ab oriente,” from the east.
    While much of Africa is east relative to Fernandes, working in Portugal, the Portuguese reached Africa by sailing
    south, and relative to Bethlehem, where the nativity of Christ occurred, Africa is south and west. Though the Horn
    of Africa extends further east than the Holy Land, traveling from East Africa to Bethlehem would still predominantly
    be a northward journey. Prester John—understood as a descendant of one of the Magi—was often situated in East
    Africa, but on the Vopel Map at least he appears in Abassia, directly south of the Holy Land.<a href="#strauss_edn16"
                                                                                                    name="strauss_ednref16"
                                                                                                    title=""><sup>[16]</sup></a>
    (See the essay on <a href="#pivar-presterjohn">Prester John by Larimore Pivar</a>) An African Magus, then, is
    difficult to comprehend as coming from the east, which perhaps enables this figure to be replaced in the Viseu
    altarpiece with an American Magus, who also complicates a directional understanding of the Magi. </p>

<p>An Amerasian worldview, particularly at the beginning of the 16<sup>th</sup> century, could sustain the possibility
    that Brazil marked a point at which east and west meet. If New World was understood as being connected to East
    Asia—a worldview which is wholly supported by the Vopel Map—it is possible that a Magus from Brazil could have made
    an immensely long land journey across the New World and Asia to reach Bethlehem.<a
            href="#strauss_edn17"
            name="strauss_ednref17"
            title=""><sup>[17]</sup></a> From a European vantage, however, people in the New World were reached by
    traveling west, not east—a distinction which is particularly important for the Portuguese and Spanish, who used this
    directional model to determine their mercantile and colonial powers over any lands discovered by sea.<a
            href="#strauss_edn18"
            name="strauss_ednref18"
            title=""><sup>[18]</sup></a> Two-dimensional cartographic representations also echo this directionality:
    although a land voyage would be possible given the geographic configuration of the Vopel Map, its organization of
    the world onto a flat plane nonetheless situates Brazil to the west of Jerusalem. The Cantino Planisphere (<a
            href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Cantino_planisphere_%281502%29.jpg"
            target="_blank">here</a>), created just after Cabral’s voyage and reflecting his new discoveries, also
    situates Brazil to the west. In this representation, the western end of Brazil is left undetermined, and it is
    uncertain whether a land route traveling westward would even be possible. </p>

<p>An anonymous Bolognese painting of the <i>Adoration of the Magi</i> (<a
        href="http://catalogo.fondazionezeri.unibo.it/scheda.v2.jsp?locale=en&amp;decorator=layout_resp&amp;apply=true&amp;tipo_scheda=F&amp;id=83108&amp;titolo=Anonimo+-+Anonimo+bolognese+-+sec.+XVI+-+Adorazione+dei+Re+Magi+-+insieme">here</a>),
    dating to the mid to late 16<sup>th</sup> century, again raises the question of how someone from the New World could
    have traveled to see the infant Christ. Here, however, the figure in question is not one of the three kings
    presenting their gifts before the Madonna and Child in the center foreground (<a
            href="http://catalogo.fondazionezeri.unibo.it/scheda.v2.jsp?locale=en&amp;decorator=layout_resp&amp;apply=true&amp;tipo_scheda=F&amp;id=83111&amp;titolo=Anonimo+-+Anonimo+bolognese+-+sec.+XVI+-+Adorazione+dei+Re+Magi+-+particolare">here</a>).
    These kings reveal a range of skin tones and geographical markers, and can plausibly be identified as a kneeling
    East Asian king who gazes up at the Christ Child who blesses him, a dark-skinned African king with a turban, and
    another turbaned king with a beard who is likely Near Eastern.<a href="#strauss_edn19"
                                                                     name="strauss_ednref19"
                                                                     title=""><sup>[19]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>One of the figures in the midground at the left of the panel (<a
        href="http://catalogo.fondazionezeri.unibo.it/scheda.v2.jsp?locale=en&amp;decorator=layout_resp&amp;apply=true&amp;tipo_scheda=F&amp;id=83110&amp;titolo=Anonimo+-+Anonimo+bolognese+-+sec.+XVI+-+Corteo+dei+Re+Magi+-+particolare">here</a>),
    however, appears to be wearing a feathered headdress and other feathered decoration around his neck, attire which
    strikingly resembles the woodcut images of cannibals made to illustrate an account of the discoveries of Amerigo
    Vespucci (Figure 2). Though it is currently impossible to identify the animal he is riding, the figure holds a
    heraldic trumpet, suggesting that he is a part of the entourage of one of the three kings. This seems to support the
    belief that the people of the New World were, in fact, inhabitants of Asia. The feathered figure here, then, must be
    understood as both a figure from the New World and the subject of an East Asian monarch. While to modern eyes, this
    appears to be an erroneous conflation of America and Asia, understanding the painting on its own historical terms
    allows both of these identities to coexist within the same figure. As the Vopel Map attests, portions of East Asia
    known to Marco Polo and the newly discovered New World were sufficiently proximate geographically to justify the
    presence of a New World figure in the retinue of a far eastern king.</p>

<p>The other set of Magian images that clearly include figures from the New World are paintings created in the Americas.
    Trexler notes that particularly in the Andean region around modern Peru, European colonizers of the early
    16<sup>th</sup> century sought for evidence that Christianity had already reached the New World in antiquity,
    including by suggesting the possibility of a Native American Magus.<a
            href="#strauss_edn20"
            name="strauss_ednref20"
            title=""><sup>[20]</sup></a> A 17<sup>th</sup> century painting by Diego de la Puente visualizes this
    possibility, showing one of the Magi in the robes and headdress of an Incan king (<a
            href="https://preview.redd.it/kvlncjnjql101.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04faf8eac1df70c5d6b0646654e5925f34353f65"
            target="_blank">here</a>).<a
            href="#strauss_edn21"
            name="strauss_ednref21"
            title=""><sup>[21]</sup></a> Unlike European images with New World figures, the inclusion of an Incan Magus
    here is most likely motivated by practical and propagandistic reasons. In the Andes, depicting three Magi from the
    Old World (for instance, an African figure, an Ottoman figure, and a Chinese figure) would have been all but
    unintelligible to most non-Europeans. The inclusion of an Incan Magus—particularly in conjunction with an African
    Magus, who would also represent a potentially recognizable physiognomic type, given the rise of trans-Atlantic
    slavery—makes the painting more accessible and comprehensible to its immediate audience. The Incan Magus could also
    serve as a model for native peoples, who could be directed to emulate this painted figure in their own devotion to
    Christ. </p>

<p>The paintings discussed above are not only valuable as a means of understanding how Europeans reconfigured their
    conception of the Magi during the Age of Exploration, but they are also pivotal because they are nearly unique
    examples of New World figures depicted in Magian images.<a href="#strauss_edn22"
                                                               name="strauss_ednref22"
                                                               title=""><sup>[22]</sup></a> Given the scarcity of
    figures shown with distinctive New World iconography in 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> century images of the
    Magi, it is important to consider other modes of visualizing these geographic discoveries. The following pages
    consider figures whose foreignness may include or refer to the New World, but in conjunction with areas that we now
    see as different geographic regions such as India and Africa. These images are particularly intriguing because of
    the flexibility of the term “India” during the Age of Exploration, variously encompassing East Africa, areas of
    South and East Asia, and the West Indies. (See the essay <a href="#riccio-india">on India and Indians by Vittoria
        Riccio</a>) Figures that appear to modern scholars to contain mixed iconography might have been originally
    intended to represent inhabitants of a greater India. It is important to note, however, that the connections between
    the subsequent images and the New World are also more tenuous—the iconographic elements discussed could equally have
    Asian or African sources, but are included here because of their potential resonances with imagery from both the Old
    World and the New. </p>

<p>A particularly rich image for this avenue of investigation is Francisco de Holanda’s <i>Adoration of the Magi</i> (<a
        href="http://bdh-rd.bne.es/viewer.vm?id=0000137315&amp;page=86"
        target="_blank">here</a>), from his <i>De aetatibus mundi imagines</i>, a collection of cosmological drawings
    from the Creation to the Apocalypse. The three Magi kneel at the right of the image, each modeling a different form
    of devotion toward the seated Virgin and the Child she holds. The foremost Magus presses his hands to the ground,
    his face down; this particular posture of worship, in conjunction with the curved sword at his side, may suggest a
    Near Eastern figure. The second Magus, who is also elderly and bearded, bows down much like his companion. His
    hands, however, are clasped in a European gesture of prayer, and his face remains turned toward the Madonna and
    Christ. If the Magus at the front appears to visualize an Islamic gesture of prayer, the second Magus is more
    reminiscent of medieval and Byzantine donor portraits, in a pose of <i>proskynesis</i> or veneration.</p>

<p>Unlike the foremost two Magi, whose very similar physiognomies, clothing, and poses offer only a suggestion of their
    geographic origins, the third Magus provides an entire range of potentially locatable iconography. The features of
    this Magus and of his followers—one depicted frontally, and another shown in profile, as though providing a full
    range of views with which to be able to understand these figures—are similar to those of African Magi, as
    exemplified by a painting by Dürer (<a
            href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_-_L%27Adoration_des_mages.jpg"
            target="_blank">here</a>). In addition to their prominent jaws and furrowed brows, these figures are shown
    beardless with short curly hair, and they each wear earrings—all attributes common to African figures.</p>

<p>The figure’s bangles and headdress, however, point to very different referents. The distinctive two-plume headdress
    is strikingly similar to one worn by a figure on a Sri Lankan casket (<a
            href="https://images.tribuneindia.com/cms/gall_content/2018/2/2018_2$largeimg15_Thursday_2018_223007377gallery.jpg"
            target="_blank">here</a>), who also wears armbands and bracelets. As this casket was a gift from the Sri
    Lankan ambassador to the Portuguese king, it is possible that Holanda could have seen it and used it as a model,
    retaining just the headband and the plumes of the Sri Lankan headdress.<a href="#strauss_edn23"
                                                                              name="strauss_ednref23"
                                                                              title=""><sup>[23]</sup></a> Figures with
    similar bangles and headgear are depicted on the Indian subcontinent in the Portuguese Miller Atlas, created in 1519
    and illustrated by none other than Francisco de Holanda’s father Antonio (<a
            href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b55002605w/f1.item.zoom"
            target="_blank">here</a>). Another comparison could be made to representations of the Mesoamerican ruler
    Moctezuma II (<a
            href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Houghton_Typ_625.99.800_Istoria_della_conquista_del_Messico_-_Motezuma.jpg"
            target="_blank">here</a> and <a
            href="https://www.gettyimages.co.nz/detail/illustration/portrait-of-montezuma-ii-tecnochtitlan-last-king-of-stock-graphic/540779689"
            target="_blank">here</a>), who also wears gold armbands and a headpiece with a plume to either side. A
    typological resemblance between Holanda’s Magus and the images of Moctezuma also extends to clothing: both figures
    are shown seminude, with only a cloak over their shoulders and another garment tied about their waists. </p>

<p>While these references read as fundamentally disparate to modern eyes, a 16<sup>th</sup>-century viewer might have
    understood them all as falling under the umbrella of the “Indies.” A closer understanding of Holanda’s perception of
    art on global terms may also help in understanding these references. As Alessandra Russo argues in a current project
    on Francisco de Holanda and artistic universalism, his commentary in both his <i>Dialogues</i> with Michelangelo and
    in <i>Da Pintura Antigua</i> reveals that he already attempted to theorize art as a universal trait of humanity.
    This sort of thinking allowed him to approach Mixtec pottery, for example, and understand it as being comparable to
    ancient Greek pottery—indeed, to consider the possibility that the New World had contact with Greco-Roman antiquity
    at some point in the past.<a href="#strauss_edn24"
                                 name="strauss_ednref24"
                                 title=""><sup>[24]</sup></a> This particular parallel is especially important for the
    drawing. Unlike the first two Magi, who are shown in attitudes of prayer, the third Magus is shown in the act of
    offering his gift: he sets down a vessel before the Virgin and Child, which looks strikingly like an ancient Greek
    shoulder lekythos (<a
            href="https://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/tools/pottery/shapes/lekythos.htm"
            target="_blank">here</a>). His two compatriots, kneeling behind him, also carry their offerings in vessels,
    though these are more difficult to identify. It is possible that the figure on the left may hold a pyxis, and the
    simpler vessel to the right may be a krater, but here the parallels to Greek pottery are less distinct.</p>

<p> These vessels, then, may be a visualization of Holanda’s concept of universal antiquity. While the lekythos seems
    (at least to modern eyes) clearly identifiable as a Greek vase, the other two slip away from recognizable types.
    Perhaps the depiction of these vessels, offered by figures who are clearly meant to be foreign—maybe even coming
    from as far as the New World—was meant to suggest a universal antiquity, visualized through their partial similarity
    to known Greco-Roman objects. Such an interpretation might imply that Holanda saw these objects as evolutionarily
    linked: at some point in the past, such as at the time when the Magi went to worship Christ, Greek pottery could
    have been a universal standard. </p>

<p>In the interest of thoroughness, it is also important to discuss a final category of images: Magi who are depicted
    using the iconography of African figures, but with the addition of feathered headwear. It is important to note at
    the outset the methodological framework for examining these images. As Peter Mason aptly observes, feathers appear
    on both Amerindian and Asian figures. Feathers thus cannot conclusively prove a connection to America; conversely,
    the absence of feathers cannot preclude such a reference.<a href="#strauss_edn25"
                                                                name="strauss_ednref25"
                                                                title=""><sup>[25]</sup></a> One might also add that
    feathers also appear on the hats of European and African figures. As a result, the examples discussed here are
    limited to occasions where the feathers seem to be the dominant features of a headdress. </p>

<p>Albrecht Dürer’s 1504 painting of the <i>Adoration of the Magi</i> (<a
        href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_-_L%27Adoration_des_mages.jpg"
        target="_blank">here</a>), and his 1511 print of the same subject (<a
        href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_-_The_Adoration_of_the_Magi_%28NGA_1943.3.3672%29.jpg"
        target="_blank">here</a>) are particularly helpful for illustrating this slippage.<a href="#strauss_edn26"
                                                                                             name="strauss_ednref26"
                                                                                             title=""><sup>[26]</sup></a>
    In the painting, an African Magus—recognizable not only because of his dark skin, but also marked by his prominent
    forehead, pronounced jaw, and curly hair—holds an elaborate red hat, decorated with jewels and two white plumes.
    Here, the hat is the focus of the image; the feathers are attached to it solely as a decoration, in the fashion of
    European hats. By contrast, in Dürer’s 1511 print, the multiple textured feathers are the visual focus of the hat
    held by the African Magus. This figure shares the same high forehead, strong jaw, and short curly hair as the
    painted figure, making him recognizably African despite his European garments, replete with slashed sleeves. A
    17<sup>th</sup> century painting of the <i>Adoration of the Magi</i> by Juan Bautista Maino also includes an African
    Magus whose headdress is overwhelmed by feathers (<a
            href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Fray_Juan_Bautista_Maino_-_Adoration_of_the_Kings_-_WGA13870.jpg"
            target="_blank">here</a>).<a
            href="#strauss_edn27"
            name="strauss_ednref27"
            title=""><sup>[27]</sup></a> Though Maino’s African king appears to have a turban wrapped around his head,
    the white band of fabric is fairly narrow, and crowned by brightly-colored feathers, like those described by
    Europeans visiting the New World.<a
            href="#strauss_edn28"
            name="strauss_ednref28"
            title=""><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p>These final examples serve also to illustrate the difficulty of finding recognizably “American” figures in early
    modern depictions of the Magi. At most, they mark isolated instances in which New World iconography is adduced to
    other figures. While it could be worth interrogating whether Far Eastern figures might have been understood by early
    modern viewers as being “American”—as part of these newly discovered lands, where East and West meet, as they do on
    the Vopel map—there is no visual evidence to support this view. It thus is important to consider possible reasons
    for this scarcity of New World references in depictions of the Magi. </p>

<p>The lack of New World iconography in images of the Magi cannot be explained by arguing that Amerindian figures were
    excluded because they were not known to the ancients living at the time of Christ, nor can it be rationalized as an
    unacceptable departure from standard iconography. Antiquity was an important lens which Europeans used to understand
    the New World, seeing the people they discovered as “living antiquities”—Holanda’s theories are a key testament to
    this worldview. Equally, the iconography of the Magi was clearly flexible: it shifted in the 15<sup>th</sup> century
    to include the figure of an African Magus, and remained fluid in the 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> centuries.
</p>

<p>A more compelling—though not comprehensive—explanation may lie in the directionality of travel, which shaped European
    understanding of the world. The Magi traveled from the East to reach the Christ Child, moving westward as they
    followed the star that led them to Bethlehem. While it might be possible to sustain the reading that a New World
    Magus could have traveled by a long land route westward, all of the Native Americans known to Europe had arrived
    there from the west, by traveling eastward. Given the flexibility of travel of an African Magus, who would
    necessarily have arrived in Bethlehem from the south, directionality does not seem to preclude a particular
    geographic origin point; nevertheless, a travel-centric interpretation of the Magi could reasonably seem
    incompatible with the people of the New World. </p>

<p>On the whole, New World figures tend to appear in images of the Magi within specific contexts, in which their
    presence plays a role in a larger theological or cosmographic paradigm. Given their rarity, American Magi cannot
    simply be understood as another mode of conveying the “exotic.” Instead, they are best understood as precise and
    contingent references. In early modern Europe—a world of Mediterranean trade, Ottoman expansion, and the increasing
    presence of African slaves—representations of proximity seem to win out over distance.  </p>
