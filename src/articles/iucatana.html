<h1>Iucatana</h1>

<p>
    In the first half of the sixteenth century, as a result of medieval depictions
    of the seemingly infinite islands of Southeast Asia (link to <a href="#archipelagus">Archipelagum
    entry</a>), many Europeans understood the Yucatan, like California, to be an
    island in the Indies. In 1517, Francisco Hernández de Córdoba led an
    expedition to the Yucatan and named it the <em>Isla Rica</em> or Wealthy
    Island, and Juan de Grijalva similarly believed he had discovered a new island
    when he sailed along the Yucatan coasts in 1518.<a

    Cortés’ map of the Gulf of Mexico that accompanied his 1520 second letter to
    Charles V (oriented with the south at the top) shows that Cortés shared this
    idea; underscoring this belief, the first Latin translation of this letter
    bore the inscription <em>De rebus et insulis noviter repertis</em>. Numerous
    maps in subsequent decades depicted the Yucatan similarly, including the Diogo Ribeiro map (1528), the Verrazano World Map
    (1529) and Giacomo Gastaldi’s highly influential <em>Universale</em> (1546).
    The Paris Gilt Globe (1528) and the Nuremberg Globe Gores (1535) both equated
    the “island” of Yucatan with Japan (link to <a href="#hispaniola-zipanga">Hispaniola entry</a>). The
    cosmographer Joannes Myritius Melitensis described the Yucatan as an island as
    late as 1590.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a>
