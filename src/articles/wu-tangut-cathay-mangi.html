<h1>Tangut, Cathay, and Mangi on sixteenth-century World Maps </h1>
<h2>Peiyue Wu</h2>
<p><b>Introduction:</b></p>
<p>During the sixteenth century, as knowledge of the New World was being transmitted back to Europe, European standards
    of world map production changed. However, cartographic representations of China still followed the conventions of
    the genre of the fifteenth century that were inherited from Marco Polo’s accounts of China. Tangut (Northwestern
    China), Cathay (Northern China), and Mangi (Southern China), the three main destinations on Polo’s itinerary in
    China, were upheld as the three main toponyms used to represent China in sixteenth century world maps, while
    “Canton”, the most important port city for Portuguese travelers in the sixteenth century, had not yet been shown in
    those maps.<a href="#_edn1"
                  name="_ednref1"
                  title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> At first glance it seems the cartographic representation of China remained
    intact, but if we look closer at the toponyms in its surroundings we begin to see that the representation of its
    geographical relationship with the New World did change.</p>
<p>By pointing out how several toponyms moved around the Old-World reference points --Cathay, Tangut, and Mangi --in a
    series of maps, I aim to show how Europeans reconfigured their conceptions of the world’s expansiveness and the
    distinctive ways that they imagined Amerasia. The main body of the essay is divided into three sections
    corresponding to the categorization of ten selected maps. While two body sections contain different manifestations
    of Amerasia, the Amerasian phenomenon is absent in the remaining one. Next, this essay will examine how <i>The
        Travels of Marco Polo </i>contributed to two types of Amerasian maps.</p>
<p><b>The Amerasian phenomenon near The Tropic of Cancer</b></p>
<p>The first type of sixteenth-century world map, which has the greatest number of surviving copies, represents Asia and
    what we now call North America as one single landmass and portrays South America as an extension of Asia. It also
    shows the Amerasian phenomenon near the Tropic of Cancer by placing the toponyms of the New World (Cuba, or
    Temixtitan) next to the Asian toponyms (Chinpagu, or Mangi).</p>
<p>Francesco Rosselli’s 1508 marine chart of the world manifests Columbus’ cosmographical belief that he had arrived in
    Asia by listing the place names originally designated by Columbus in his fourth voyage along the coast of Nicaragua
    to Eastern Panama, today known as Central America, along the east coast of Asia.<a href="#_edn2"

                                                                                       title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>The Travels of Marco Polo</i> influenced Columbus’s cosmographical conceptualization. Since Marco Polo had
    expanded the eastern end of the island of the Earth by exploring the immense Chinese provinces of Cathay and Mangi,
    along with an adjacent archipelago and the great island of Cipangu, Columbus gained the impression that the
    intervening ocean between the western shores of Europe and the eastern shores of Asia were not very great, leading
    him to convince the Spanish court to allow him to sail west to India. As soon as he sighted land sometime between
    the eleventh and twelfth of October, 1492, he was sure he had arrived in Asia.<a href="#_edn3"
                                                                                     name="_ednref3"
                                                                                     title=""><sup>[3]</sup></a>
    Whatever he saw during the rest of his exploration he interpreted as empirical evidence of this fixed belief. Here
    we have to bear in mind that <i>The Travels of Marco Polo</i> did not serve as textual evidence for Columbus to
    prove that land was Asia; rather, it served as a formulation in Columbus’s mind which was so deep-rooted that it
    made him consistently align his exploration along the coast of the New Land with Marco Polo’s return trip from
    Zaiton to Europe.<a href="#_edn4"

<p>In the Gilt Globe (1528), while “Tangut” is placed on the Northwest side of “Cathay” and “Mangi” on the south,
    “Hispania Nova” indicates the territory of New Spain at the center of the triangle formed by “Tangut”, ‘Cathay“ and
    “Mangi”. “Temixtitan” is depicted right above “Mangi”. In terms of Oronce Finé’s map (1534), “Temixtitan”
    (Tenochtitlan) and “Messigo”(Mexico) are regional names in the province of Mangi.</p>

<p>Similarly, in Giovanni Vavassore's copy (1558) of Caspar Vopel’s world map (1545)<u>, </u>“Hispania Nova” appears
    underneath “Mangi”. From the map we can tell that “Temixtitan” is also located in the southeast towards “Mangi”, but
    further southeast than in Finé’s map.</p>

<p><b>An absence of Amerasia</b></p>
<p>The second type of world map experiments with a total separateness between Asia and today’s American continent. For
    example, the Waldseemüller map (1507) is the first to portray America’s insular nature and its absolute separateness
    from Asia. On the right side of the map, Tangut, Cathay, and Mangi run along the eastern coast of Asia from north to
    south. Waldseemüller’s map served as a prototype for maps like Abraham Ortelius’s <i>Typus Orbis Terrarum</i> (1570)
    over half a century later.</p>

<p>The coexistence of the Waldseemüller map (1507) with the Rosselli map (1508) shows Europeans’ various views about the
    New Land. The development of world maps in the sixteenth century could not be seen as a teleological process where a
    much clearer picture of the modern worldview came into being over time. Instead, it was a period when plural
    worldviews driven by different ideologies co-existed and reshaped each other during the sixteenth century. While
    Amerasia was a dominant worldview in the sixteenth century, it did adjust and rearrange itself, responding to the
    challenges posed by its opposite side --the maps showing the hypothesis that Asia and the New World were separated
    from one another. Meanwhile, even maps or mapmakers that experimented with a two-continent vision were subject to
    changing their minds, as Waldseemüller reverted to an Amerasian vision of the world in his 1516 Carta Marina.
    Furthermore, sometimes even when maps separated the continents, they still embraced an Amerasian view.</p>
<p><b>The Amerasian phenomenon in the North</b></p>
<p>After Waldseemüller, many began to accept that South America was a New World, but the North American connection to
    Asia persisted. In the middle of the sixteenth century there emerged a third type of world map which separated the
    east coast of Asia from the lower part of today’s North America with a vast ocean. </p>
<p>In response to this trend of separating Asia from today’s North America in the area around the Tropic of Cancer, the
    Amerasian phenomenon persisted by spreading northward. The displacement of several Asian toponyms around Cathay,
    such as Ania and Toloman, plays an essential role in displaying Amerasia’s new form at the stage when China was no
    longer intermingled with Mexico.<a href="#_edn5"

                                       title=""><sup>[5]</sup></a> According to Marco Polo, Toloman was an Asian kingdom
    in southwestern China abundant in gold. When he was sent to travel west by the Great Khan, Polo visited Toloman on
    his return voyage after passing through Tibet and reported that it was near India.<a href="#_edn6"
                                                                                         name="_ednref6"

    Among the maps that have been introduced, the Behaim globe (1492), the Ruysch map (1507), and the Waldseemüller map
    (1507) all placed Toloman next to Cathay.</p>

<p>However, among the third type of world maps, Giacomo Gastaldi and Giuseppe Rosaccio’s maps (1561 and 1598,
    respectively) transport the Asian toponym of Tolman across the Strait of Anian to the other side of the world. This
    move was triggered by a new version of <i>The Travels of Marco Polo</i> published by Giovanni Battista Ramusio in
    1556. This new edition included texts describing the geographic relationship between Asia and the New World, which
    was absent from all previous editions of <i>The Travels of Marco Polo</i>.<a

<p style="margin: 10%;">“Leaving the port of Zaitum (modern Quanzhou), one sails westward and a bit southwest for 1500
    miles, passing through a gulf named Cheinan (roughly the modern South China Sea) which takes two months to travel
    across, navigating towards the north. The entire gulf is bounded on the southeast side by the province of Manzi and
    on the other side by Ania and Toloman, besides many other provinces … This gulf is very large, and so many people
    live there that it seems almost (like) another world.”<a href="#_edn8"
                                                             name="_ednref8"

<p>In <i>The Venetian Discovery of the World</i>, Elizabeth Horodowich argues that it is Ramusio that encouraged
    Gastaldi to understand that Toloman was “on the other side” of this large gulf, in “another world,” a New World. The
    placement of toponyms mentioned in <i>The Travel of Marco Polo, </i>such as Tolman in the New World, emphasized the
    New World’s connection to the Venetian historical figure, which reflected how Venetians positioned themselves in the
    exploration of the New World even if they didn’t physically participate in the age of discoveries.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>Marco Polo’s exploration of the Land of the East unfolded around Cathay, and his itinerary provided the basic
    geographical knowledge of East Asia, serving as an established textual source for European cartographers to depict
    China on world maps from the late fourteenth century.<a href="#_edn9"
                                                            name="_ednref9"
                                                            title=""><sup>[9]</sup></a> In the sixteenth century, as the
    European Age of Encounters unfolded concurrently with the print revolution, accounts of Columbian voyages were
    disseminated around Europe with his point of view of seeing the New World and Asia as one.<a href="#_edn10"
                                                                                                 name="_ednref10"
                                                                                                 title=""><sup>[10]</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Marco Polo’s effect on Columbus’ cosmographical concepts contributed to the pervasiveness of a series of Amerasian
    maps that depict today’s Mexico Gulf and China Sea as one and place Mexico within the land of Asia throughout the
    sixteenth century. But in the second half of the sixteenth century, there was a tendency for more maps separating
    these two regions at a great distance. </p>
<p>However, this perceived separation did not mean that the Amerasian phenomenon no longer existed in this group of
    maps. The publication of a new edition of <i>The Travels of Marco Polo </i>published by Ramusio in the 1550s pushed
    the Amerasian phenomenon into a new form in the north, responding to the maps that separate Asia and the New World
    in the area near the Tropic of Cancer. When European cartographers expressed the idea of Amerasia they could either
    squeeze some toponyms of the New World into Asia, as they did in the region near the Tropic of Cancer, or they could
    extend some Asian toponymies, like Toloman, towards the other side of world, as they did in the North.</p>
