<h1>Bangala</h1>

<p>
    Under the toponym of Bangala, or Bengal, shown here to the left of a seated
    king, Vopel tells us that “The inhabitants have a king and their own language.
    They are idolaters. [This place] is rich in maize, galangal, ginger, and
    sugar” (<em
>Incolae habent regem et linguam/ propriam. sunt idolatrae. abun/dant. spico
    [sic], galanga, zinzibere, et saccaro</em
>). Located today in the northeastern part of the Indian subcontinent, on the
    coast of the Bay of Bengal and at the delta of the Ganges (and indeed, Vopel
    shows a Kingdom of Bangella on the far right edge of the map, just south of
    India Alta), this second Bengal appears here at the center of the Amerasian
    continent.
