<h1>Peru Provincia</h1>

<p>
    To the east of his label for Peru Provincia, under the toponym Arvaceas, Vopel
    tells us that “The province Peru, which is also New Spain, discovered in the
    year 1530, has of silver and gold what the world has of everything, and they
    produce a very profitable supply of grain twice in a year, and the inhabitants
    adequately develop trade and all civilization,” (<em
>Peru prouintia, quae et Nova Castilia/ inventa Anno M.D.iii omnium quos/
    orbis habet auri atque argenti ditissima/ frumenta bis in anno producit
    Incolae commertia [sic] atque omnem humanita/tem satis excolunt.</em

    The biannual harvest was considered by some to be a feature of the tropical
    zone (see entry on Zonal hemispherical maps). The fact that Europeans found
    Peru to be as rich in silver and gold led some Europeans to hypothesize that
    Ophir, the site of King Solomon’s mines otherwise located in India, was
    located in Peru (see Riccio essay on Ophir). The reference to two harvests per
    year is an ancient idea often associated with the fertility of India. The
    ancient historians and indographers Megasthenes and Diodorus Siculus presented
    India as a land rich with veins of gold, silver, copper, iron, and tin, as
    well as exceedingly fertile in fruits and grains of all kinds, which grew so
    abundantly that they could be harvested twice a year.<a

    The excessive fertility and richness of India was understood to be a direct
    result of its occupying the central climatic zone, or <em>zona torrida</em>,
    near the equator. Peru is shown on the map just below the equator, and
    accordingly participates in a climatic or zonal similarity with India (see
    link to zonal map of the world). Although it is presented as part of America
    in the new world, <em>Novus Orbis</em>, Peru is described here in distinctly
    Indian terms.
