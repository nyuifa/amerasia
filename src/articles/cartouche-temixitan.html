<p>Themixitan or in new form Thenostica, earlier Quinsay, which means the city of God according to the Venetian Marco
    Polo, on the other hand was called Themistam by Oderico. And that is nearer the truth, in concordance and agreement
    with the traditions of both about the resources and political powers of that region. Indeed, earlier accounts had
    revealed Tenochtitlan to be a town set in a salt lake, and to exceed the city of Venice in splendor and a great deal
    in size. From Hernan Cortes one hears reports of an eastern Emperor also known as Great Khan named Montezuma. Here
    there was a palace, the most magnificent houses of all the bordering peoples, and the seat of power of the region.
    The people are remarkable, and excelling in faith, and writers have offered their opinion about the nature of those
    things and of the emperor, and about the size of the city, the riches, and the power. Some of the residents are
    idolaters, others Christian. For the good news of Christ is always planted through the work of the brothers of the
    order of Saint Francis not only in Temixtitan but in all of Greater Asia, especially under the aegis of Hernan
    Cortes.</p>
