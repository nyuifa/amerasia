<h1>Margaritas</h1>

<p>
  Vopel tells us here that on the western coast of the Amerasian continent,
  “these shores abound with large pearls and gold” (<em
    >Margaritis/ vnionibus, auro/ haec scatent lit/tora</em
  >). Pearls often indicated perceived connections between Orient and Occident.
  On his third voyage, for instance, Columbus believed the islands off the coast
  of Venezuela to be the pearl producing islands of Asia, perhaps those
  described by the medieval cosmographer Pierre d’Ailly; Columbus called the
  extreme western end of the Gulf of Paria the “Gulf of Pearls”, even though no
  pearls were found there.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> As the
  literary scholar Beatriz Pastor Bodmer puts it, for Columbus, “the
  identification of America with his Asian model depended on his success in
  finding them.”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a> Following the conquest
  of Tenochtitlan, in his third letter of 1523, Cortés similarly described how
  the discovery of a new coastline to the West had fired his imagination: “[A]ll
  those who have some learning and experience in the navigation of the Indies
  are quite certain that once the route to the Southern Sea has been discovered
  we shall find many islands rich in gold, pearls, precious stones and
  spices.”<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a> For Cortés, Asian islands
  rich in pearls and precious stones were not far from the Mexican coast. In
  1597, a letter written from Pueblo de los Angeles described the island of
  California rich in “very fair Oriental pearls,” indicating the persistence of
  dreams of Oriental wealth.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a> In October
  of 1598, having heard reports of pearls and having seen their shells, the
  conquistador Don Juan de Oñate traveled west across the Rio Grande and led a
  detachment of mounted soldiers to search for the South Sea which he thought
  was nearby and “whose trade with Peru, New Spain, and China should not be
  underestimated.”<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a> Oñate planned to
  develop a Pacific port, so he knew he was not in Asia, but he certainly
  thought he was close. Pearls had a special place material and symbolic place
  in the functioning of the Amerasian mentality; for these observers and many
  others, the presence of pearls implied the proximity of Asia and the Americas.
