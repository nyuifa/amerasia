<h1>The Parrot’s Tale: the Bird’s Fall from Exotic Temptation to Common Commodity
</h1>
<h2>Claire Lipsman</h2>
<p>In Jan van Eyck’s 1436 <i><a
        href="http://vlaamseprimitieven.vlaamsekunstcollectie.be/en/collection/madonna-with-canon-joris-van-der-paele" target="_blank">Virgin
    and Child with Canon van der Paele </a></i> , the child holds a either a Ring-Necked Parakeet or an Alexandrine
    Parakeet, both native to India.<a href="#_lipsman_edn1"
                                      name="_lipsman_ednref1"
                                      title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> Having been pets of Europe’s elite for centuries, it is not
    surprising to find either species here.<a href="#_lipsman_edn2" name="_lipsman_ednref2" title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a> As a court painter, van Eyck would likely have had
    access to a live specimen to serve as a model for the parrot rather than having to paint from descriptions or
    borrowing from another artist’s work. Before this painting, parrots had not often been included in religious
    imagery.<a href="#_lipsman_edn3" name="_lipsman_ednref3" title=""><sup>[3]</sup></a> To understand the parrot’s presence in this image and its increasing popularity after
    Columbus’s initial voyages to the lands we now know as the Americas, we need to examine the bird’s association with
    Paradise.</p>
<p>During the Middle Ages in Europe it was widely believed that Eden was in the East. The parrots Europe traded for were
    primarily Asian birds. In recognizing these two points, the connection between parrots and Paradise becomes
    apparent. They had been paired with other exotic birds, like their fellow Indian species, the peacock, in depictions
    of Paradise. This context makes the individual parakeet’s inclusion in van Eyck’s pre-Columbus painting all the more
    puzzling.<a href="#_lipsman_edn4"
                name="_lipsman_ednref4"
                title=""><sup>[4]</sup></a> The painting does not depict a garden or an outdoor scene at all. Instead, the canon
    kneels in prayer with Saints Donation and George flanking the panel and the Virgin, Child, and parakeet enthroned as
    a trio in the center. The animal’s ability to speak gives us some explanation for its association with Eden and
    account for its presence in van Eyck’s panel.</p>
<p>The speaking bird was thought to say “<i>Ave</i>” in greeting, just as the archangel Gabriel had said to the Virgin
    Mary in the Annunciation. Dominican Franciscus di Retza wrote of the bird’s word in connection with Gabriel’s
    greeting, linking the parrot with the angel and the Annunciation.<a
            href="#_lipsman_edn5"
            name="_lipsman_ednref5"
            title=""><sup>[5]</sup></a> In addition to voice, the impermeability of the parrot’s green feathers was associated
    with Mary’s virginity. The combination of these elements identify the bird as an “angelic
    messenger.”<a href="#_lipsman_edn6"
                  name="_lipsman_ednref6"
                  title=""><sup>[6]</sup></a> Beyond the association with the Virgin, Carol Purtle explains that because the
    Christ Child is playing with the bird, the parakeet places the scene in heaven, rather than in an earthly
    paradise.<a href="#_lipsman_edn7"
                name="_lipsman_ednref7"
                title=""><sup>[7]</sup></a> Instead of having it serve as a messenger to the Virgin, van Eyck intentionally
    placed the parrot in Christ’s hands, relating it to both the Child and His mother. Mary and Christ were often
    understood to be the new Adam and Eve, and the bird positioned between them may allude to this succession. By making
    the viewer recall the original residents of Paradise, the parrot’s presence works with the silk hung behind the
    group. The cloth’s rose pattern on a green background refers to enclosed gardens: Eden, metaphors for Mary’s
    virginity, and, in literature of the time, “a mystic setting for transcendent experience.”<a href="#_lipsman_edn8"
                                                                                                 name="_lipsman_ednref8"
                                                                                                 title=""><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>
<p> Purtle and John Ward have both proposed that the canon is having a vision of his postmortem introduction to Christ
    in heaven.<a href="#_lipsman_edn9"
                 name="_lipsman_ednref9"
                 title=""><sup>[9]</sup></a> This interpretation clarifies the parrot’s participation in the scene. The panel was
    commissioned for van der Paele’s tomb as his health declined, meaning that it was created with a particular
    awareness of the canon’s mortality. Known for its greeting of <i>“Ave” </i>and its association with Paradise, the
    parrot turns to him and welcomes him to heaven.<a href="#_lipsman_edn10"
                                                      name="_lipsman_ednref10"
                                                      title=""><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>
<p>Van Eyck’s composition of the Virgin and Child with a green parakeet was imitated again and again over the course of
    the next century and a half. After Columbus’s voyages and the arrival of American parrots in Europe however, we see
    parrots appear in art more often. We also see a greater diversity in the species represented. Soon after Columbus’s
    voyages, we see ever more frequent depictions of macaws, a group of parrot subspecies native to the Americas. Over
    the course of the 16<sup>th</sup>century, Europeans became accustomed to these new parrots and began depicting them
    alongside African and Asian species. By the 17<sup>th</sup>century, parrots of all kinds were relatively common in
    Europe and appeared with some regularity in still lives as well as narrative scenes.<a href="#_lipsman_edn11"
                                                                                           name="_lipsman_ednref11"
                                                                                           title=""><sup>[11]</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Many visitors to the new lands across the Atlantic remarked upon the large flocks of parrots found there. Some took
    finding a species associated with India as a sign that they were in India, or somewhere like it. In October of 1492,
    Columbus wrote, “other than parrots, I have seen no beast of any kind on this island.”<a href="#_lipsman_edn12"
                                                                                             name="_lipsman_ednref12"
                                                                                             title=""><sup>[12]</sup></a> He
    refers to parrots several more times in his journals describing first voyage. When Pedro Cabral landed in Brazil in
    1500, he wrote that this “new land…<sup>[is]</sup>that of the parrots.”<a href="#_lipsman_edn13"
                                                                               name="_lipsman_ednref13"
                                                                               title=""><sup>[13]</sup></a> As Europe familiarized itself
    with the Americas, parrots came to symbolize the mysterious lands across the Atlantic. Geographically located to the
    west of Europe, the Americas were often understood to be an extension of the East. Early on, the presence of parrots
    appeared to confirm this idea.</p>
<p>As the “New World”, a term used to refer to newly discovered lands in Asia as well as America, was charted through
    maps, parrots became emblematic of certain parts of the world.<i> </i>Parrots often appear on other maps as
    illustrations within the landmasses of Africa and what a modern viewer would understand to be South America, then
    thought to be part of Asia.<a href="#_lipsman_edn14"

    at the top of the map. A depiction of Christ’s head is in the East, marking the top of the map, and just below it,
    to the right of the two rivers that flow into Christ, is a parrot.<a href="#_lipsman_edn16"
                                                                         name="_lipsman_ednref16"

<p>The <a

    printed in 1502, is one of the first maps to depict the new lands discovered by Columbus.<a href="#_lipsman_edn17"
                                                                                                name="_lipsman_ednref17"

    is also the first to use parrots to mark this land mass. <a href="#_lipsman_edn18"
                                                                name="_lipsman_ednref18"
                                                                title=""><sup>[18]</sup></a> These new lands are shown as
    ambiguously shaped, making it clear that they are not yet fully explored. With no border or coast in the West,
    Cantino leaves the possibility the mass we now call South America may continue on into Asia. This idea is confirmed
    by the map’s original title, <i>Carta de navigar per le Isole nouam tr<sup>[ovate]</sup>in le parte de India: dono Alberto
        Cantino al S. Duca Hercole </i> or <i>Map for navigating the new islands found in the parts of India: a gift of
        Alberto Cantino for S. Duke Hercole </i> . Though he is depicting unexplored territory, Cantino follows
    Columbus’s example and assimilates it into Europe’s existing understanding of the world by describing it as part of
    India. The familiar green parrots of modern-day Senegal and African Grey Parrots of Central Africa are contrasted
    with the bright red macaws of America. The depiction of a species on more than one continent is atypical, even of
    later maps. Cartographers usually used animals to mark differences between places.</p>
<p>Here on the Vopel Map<i>, </i>Cabral’s “land of the parrots” is indicated twice. First, it appears in its Latin
    translation, “ <i>Papagalli</i> <i> terra” </i>on the landmass we now recognize as South America. The second
    appearance of parrots is in a fictional land placed in the same location as Antarctica. They are depicted in the
    eastern half of a land mass labeled as “ Antarcticus ” and “Terra Australis nondum cognita ,” which translates to
    “Southern land not yet known”. This phrase often included when maps depict Terra Australis. <a href="#_lipsman_edn19"
                                                                                                   name="_lipsman_ednref19"
                                                                                                   title=""><sup>[19]</sup></a>
    The birds are represented by an illustration of three parrots accompanied by the phrase “ Psitacorum Terra” – the
    Latin translation of Cabral’s words. </p>
<p>The effort to distribute flora and fauna geographically was complicated by the absence of a clear taxonomic system.
    Although of different subspecies and modern taxonomic families, monkeys and parrots could be found in Africa, Asia,
    and South America.<a href="#_lipsman_edn20"
                         name="_lipsman_ednref20"
                         title=""><sup>[20]</sup></a> The effort to represent traditionally understood distributions even as new
    species within these orders were encountered may have contributed to the understanding that the Americas were an
    extension of Asia. This interpretation of the new lands may account for why, after Columbus’s voyages, parrots
    appear less in places believed to be Asia in the East and more in places believed to be Asia in the West. The
    assembling of different species under the order Psitacciformes became representative of the “New World” as a whole,
    the place where East and West meet.</p>
<p>Because the Americas were originally considered by Europeans to be a continuation of Asia around the other side of
    the world, it was logical to place Eden, in the farthest East: in the Americas. The first known use of a parrot in a
    Temptation scene is Albrecht Dürer’s 1504 <i><a
            href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/the-fall-of-man-adam-and-eve/iQHbY2Sl7lrL0A" target="_blank">Adam and Eve</a></i>
    <i> </i>engraving.<a href="#_lipsman_edn21"
                         name="_lipsman_ednref21"
                         title=""><sup>[21]</sup></a> Erwin Panofsky’s analysis of the bird above Adam suggests that its presence
    is meant to offset the evil of the serpent behind Eve. This is consistent with pre-Columbian associations between
    parrots and the purity of virginity. The long tail on Dürer’s parrot indicates an American species. Dürer had three
    parrots in his household: his wife had a small green one, likely to be an Indian bird, and he received one from
    Málaga.<a href="#_lipsman_edn22"
              name="_lipsman_ednref22"
              title=""><sup>[22]</sup></a> It is unclear if the third parrot was a second green one or a second from Málaga but
    it is reasonable to guess that it came as one in a pair. We do not know what species Dürer’s parrot was, but coming
    from a city on the coast of Spain, it is likely that it was a macaw from the Americas. </p>
<p> Though parrots became more common in Europe through trade, they maintained their status as exotic and representative
    of the New World, that is, lands at the ends of the earth from Europe. Andrea del Sarto’s <i><a
            href="http://www.travelingintuscany.com/images/art/andreadelsarto/triumphofcaesar700.jpg" target="_blank">Triumph of
        Caesar</a></i> employs multiple parrot species to depict this idea.<a href="#_lipsman_edn23"
                                                                              name="_lipsman_ednref23"
                                                                              title=""><sup>[23]</sup></a> Two of the parrot
    types can be identified with confidence: the African Gray Parrots and Ring-Necked Parakeets inside the cage. The
    bird perched atop the cage may be a Red and Green Macaw from South America or a Crimson Shining Parrot from Fiji.
    Trade routes from the time make both birds possibilities.<a href="#_lipsman_edn24"
                                                                name="_lipsman_ednref24"
                                                                title=""><sup>[24]</sup></a> While the body markings and beak
    size of del Sarto’s red bird have more in common with the Fijian parrot, the bird’s apparent overbite, where the top
    portion of the beak extends far over the bottom and white spot around the eye indicate that it is meant to be a Red
    and Green Macaw. With the understanding that this 16<sup>th</sup>century painting depicts Caesar receiving tribute
    from the farthest reaches of his empire, it would make more sense for the parrots to represent all directions in
    which the species was found, rather than just the lands immediately to the south and east of
    Europe.<a href="#_lipsman_edn25"
              name="_lipsman_ednref25"
              title=""><sup>[25]</sup></a> Though the Roman Empire did not reach all the way to the Americas, del Sarto’s world
    had just expanded to encompass new lands as the Roman world expanded with each successful conquest. The inclusion of
    what we now know to be an American bird is also a reference to the newly extended reach of contemporary European
    empires.</p>
<p> Prior to the exploration of the New World, parrots signaled that a scene took place in either Paradise or a heavenly
    realm. As the number of voyages increased between Europe and the Americas, a trade in exotic birds turned the parrot
    into a multivalent symbol. They represented the Americas and the vastness of the globe. They also came to acquire
    another meaning. Because parrots could be taught to imitate human speech, they were seen as a metaphor for the
    artist’s mimicry of life. Peter Paul Rubens played with these new meanings in addition to the bird’s traditionally
    religious meanings in his various depictions of parrots. His circa 1628 <i><a
            href="https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/art-work/adam-and-eve/de0047db-6f8b-4761-a55b-ad41e959cca2" target="_blank">Adam
        and Eve</a></i> is an almost direct copy of <a
            href="https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/art-work/adam-and-eve/e0ca4331-fb89-47a7-9ba0-be0ece23426b" target="_blank">Titian’s
        <i>Adam and Eve</i></a> from about eighty years earlier.<a href="#_lipsman_edn26"
                                                                   name="_lipsman_ednref26"
                                                                   title=""><sup>[26]</sup></a> The key difference between the
    two is that Rubens has added a macaw in the tree branch over Adam’s shoulder. The placement of Adam and the parrot
    on the same side of the painting as well as their spatial relationship, with the bird over his shoulder, are
    reminiscent of Dürer’s <i>Adam and Eve</i> engraving discussed above. Because it was now understood that Eden was
    not likely to be in the New World, parrots were not often used as a symbol of Eden.  They were, however, still a
    species that could place a scene in a faraway place. Because Rubens adds the macaw to an existing composition, he is
    amalgamating two artists’ works in one painting.<a
            href="#_lipsman_edn27"
            name="_lipsman_ednref27"
            title=""><sup>[27]</sup></a> Irma Jaffe proposes that between the old belief that Paradise was in the Americas and
    the fact that Ruben’s access to macaws was a likely result of painting this work in Spain, the parrot may also refer
    to Spanish holdings in America. Rubens would have seen Titian’s original <i>Adam and Eve</i> in the Spanish Royal
    collections, where it resided at the time. The parrot is a nod to the traditional interpretations of parrots in art,
    a double reference to Titian and Dürer , and an allusion to the power and reach of the Spanish throne. </p>
<p>             The <i>Adam and Eve</i> was not the first time Rubens had included a parrot in a religious scene. His
    1613-1615 work, <i><a
            href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/the-holy-family-with-the-parrot/ogEkvf1C1th7Rg" target="_blank">The Holy
        Family with a Parrot</a></i> includes a Blue and Yellow Macaw perched on a column base behind Christ.<a
            href="#_lipsman_edn28"
            name="_lipsman_ednref28"
            title=""><sup>[28]</sup></a> The spatial relationship between Christ and the parrot is the same as that between Adam
    and his respective bird. Both macaws rest on a surface just over the shoulder of the figure below them. In <i>Adam
        and Eve</i>, the parrot passively watches the scene unfold.  In <i>The Holy Family with a Parrot</i>, it ignores
    the family and turns its attention to the vine grasped in its beak. This scene goes back to the association of Mary
    and Christ serving as the new Adam and Eve. Like van Eyck’s <i>Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele , </i>the
    parrot makes the viewer think of Eden and the original sin from which the mother and Son serve as redemption. </p>
<p>Rubens’ depiction of Mary, Joseph, and Christ is one of the few examples of the Virgin and Child with a parrot that
    is not a copy or partial copy of van Eyck’s work<i>.</i> The fact that it comes 200 years after van Eyck’s painting
    shows that a connection between parrots and religious imagery remains in some form. The link in Rubens’s work may
    simply be that the association of parrots with Christian themes has become traditional through repetition. With too
    much diversity in its employment to constitute any one image type, the parrot becomes a motif of Adam and Eve and
    the newer, redemptive pair, Mary and Christ. A multifaceted symbol in Rubens’ <i>The Holy Family with a Parrot</i>,
    the bird works with the Oriental rug folded up directly below it to place the scene somewhere outside of Europe. 
</p>
<p>As Europeans developed a concept of America as separate from Asia, the parrot came to symbolize the Americas in the
    west more than Asia in the east. This painting shows that the memory of parrots representing the East and the exotic
    survived into the 17th century and reminds us of Europe’s earlier association of America and Asia. By employing an
    American bird in an Eastern scene, Rubens depicts parrot species as interchangeable with one another across a range
    extending from America to Asia.<a href="#_lipsman_edn29"

<p>Bruce Boehrer points out that Rubens paints parrots as both objects in a scene and as their own living beings. This
    is evident in the number of paintings that show different parrot species, including a portrait of a Scarlet Macaw
    from the 1630’s simply titled <i><a
            href="http://www.artandarchitecture.org.uk/images/gallery/d8488ed8.html" target="_blank">Parrot</a></i> <i>.<a
            href="#_lipsman_edn30"
            name="_lipsman_ednref30"
            title=""> <b><sup>[30]</sup></b> </a></i> In this painting, the carefully rendered bird is the only living thing.
    Like many subjects of human portraits, it sits very still. A mountainous landscape stretches out behind it. At this
    point in history, the landscape may represent Europe instead of the parrot’s native territory. </p>
<p>By the 1520’s, parrots had become so popular in Spain that explorers no longer felt the need to include them in their
    listings of American species. When writing about the animals of the “New World” in 1526, Gonzálo Fernandez de Oviedo
    does not mention parrots at all. He glosses over their exclusion by explaining that it is a waste of time and
    writing space to discuss species that are already readily available in Spain.<a

            title=""><sup>[31]</sup></a> There is archaeological evidence to support this widespread trade in exotic birds. Two
    parrot bones dated to the 17<sup>th</sup>century were found at Norwich’s Castle Mall, which was certainly not a hub
    of cosmopolitan activity at the time. <a

            title=""><sup>[32]</sup></a> The number of macaw species represented by Rubens and the increasing representations of
    parrots through the 17<sup>th</sup>century are both indicators of the booming market for exotic birds.</p>
<p>The parrot trade developed hybrid species of macaws. In Ruben’s 1635 <i><a
        href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/rubens-his-wife-helena-fourment-1614%E2%80%931673-and-their-son-frans-1633%E2%80%931678/xgFC_TOdAAR2nQ" target="_blank">Rubens,
    His wife Helena Fourment , and Their Son Frans</a></i> , we find another one of his macaws. This one, however, is
    not as easily identified as the ones examined thus far.<a
            href="#_lipsman_edn33"
            name="_lipsman_ednref33"
            title=""><sup>[33]</sup></a> This bird appears to be a hybrid species, a phenomenon that is not known to occur in the
    wild. Today, the crossbreed is known as a Harlequin Macaw, resulting from a pairing of a Red and Green Macaw with a
    Blue and Gold Macaw.<a href="#_lipsman_edn34"
                           name="_lipsman_ednref34"
                           title=""><sup>[34]</sup></a> The presence of this bird in a 17<sup>th</sup>century painting can mean
    one of two things. The first, is that a male and female of the species in question were simply kept in a cage
    together and happened to mate. The second possibility is that the hybrid was bred intentionally. It is impossible to
    know how exactly this particular bird came to be, but both situations would be the direct result of the parrot trade
    and the unnatural groupings in which the birds were kept. Surely once bird merchants were aware that macaws of
    different subspecies could breed with one another to create unique color patterns, they would begin to use this to
    increase their birds sales. Being a family portrait, the inclusion of a bird with out-of-the-ordinary parentage can
    be read as a reference to procreation. If the bird was bred intentionally, it may also be a reference to the careful
    selection of a spouse and subsequent courtship its human contemporaries practiced. </p>
<p>By examining parrots, we see how Europeans assimilated the new variety of birds into their existing notions of
    Paradise and the associated iconography. As they explored the region and better understood its geography, parrots
    came to symbolize the Americas and the expansion of Europe’s interactivity with the world. Finally, parrots came to
    gain their own meaning to Europeans, independent of their Amerasian origins. Boehrer notes how the increasing
    appearance of parrots in still lives through the 17<sup>th</sup>century demonstrates their fall in status. Prior to
    1492, they had served as angelic messengers to men but by the 1600s they had become traded commodities. </p>

    less like Senegal Parrots and more like Ring-Necked Parakeets, also native to this part of Africa. The second set of

      title=""><sup>[25]</sup></a> In contrast, del Sarto only includes two monkeys despite the fact that they are native to
    Asia, Africa, and America like the parrot. The monkeys in this painting are unidentified, but their locations within
    the overall composition are worth noting. A blonde white-faced monkey rides on a man’s shoulders just left of the
    painting’s center as they ascend the stairs. A white- and red-haired, black-faced monkey sits on the steps to the
    right, across an empty space left in just below the middle of the fresco. They seem to look at each other. The
    black-faced monkey is dressed in a tunic while the blonde one is naked. They appear to be intentionally opposed to
    one another. George argues that Europeans would have understood that the “New World” monkeys of America were
    different from the “Old World” monkeys they were familiar with in Asia and Africa (the terms New World and Old World
    are used here as the taxonomic designations set by the scientific community). A key morphological and behavioral
    difference between the monkeys of these regions becomes obvious after observation. New World monkeys have prehensile
    tails that they use to climb and grasp while Old World monkeys do not. Neither of the monkeys in this painting use
    their tails, but the contrast of clothed and nudity in conjunction with the space left between them leads me to
    believe that they are meant to represent the distance between what was familiar to Europe and what was new to them.
