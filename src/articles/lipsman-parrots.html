    On this map, Vopel indicates the South American continent with the label
    <i>America Nova Orbis Pars</i>. Below the word <i>Nova</i>, we can see the
    phrase <i>Papagalli terra</i>, or, "land of the parrots". This phrase was used
    in many descriptions of the landmass, most notably by Christopher Columbus and
    Pedro Cabral. Both explorers and the influence of their words on maps of
    Amerasia are discussed in more detail below. A more fitting place to begin
    understanding Vopel's reason for including parrots on this map would be to
    examine the symbolism of parrots before the Columbus's initial voyage to what
    became known as the New World.

    In Jan van Eyck's 1436 <i>Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele</i>, the
    child holds a either a Ring-Necked Parakeet or an Alexandrine Parakeet.

    Both small parrot varieties, native to India, had been pets of Europe's elite
    for centuries. It is therefore not surprising to find either species here.<a

    As a court painter, van Eyck would likely have had access to a live specimen
    to serve as a model for the parakeet rather than having to paint from
    descriptions or borrowing from another artist's work. Before this painting,
    parrots had not often been included in religious imagery.<a
        href="#_edn2"
        name="_ednref2"
        title=""

    To understand the parrot's presence in this painting and its increasing
    popularity after Columbus's initial voyages to the lands we now know as the
    Americas, we need to examine the bird's association with Paradise.
</p>
<p>
    The parrot's ability to speak gives us some explanation for its association
    with Eden and account for its presence in van Eyck's panel. During the Middle
    Ages in Europe it was widely believed that Eden was in the East. The parrots
    exchanged on European markets were primarily Asian birds. In recognizing these
    two points, the connection between parrots and Paradise becomes apparent. They
    had been paired with other exotic birds, like their fellow Indian species, the
    peacock, in past depictions of Paradise. This context makes the individual
    parakeet's inclusion in van Eyck's pre-Columbus painting all the more
    puzzling.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> The painting does
    not depict a garden or an outdoor scene at all. Instead, the canon kneels in
    prayer with Saints Donation and George flanking the panel and the Virgin,
    Child, and parakeet are enthroned as a trio in the center.
</p>
<p>
    The speaking bird was thought to say "<i>Ave</i>" in greeting, just as the
    archangel Gabriel said to the Virgin Mary in the Annunciation. Dominican
    Franciscus di Retza wrote of the bird's word in connection with Gabriel's
    greeting, linking the parrot with the angel and the Annunciation.<a
        href="#_edn4"
        name="_ednref4"
        title=""
>[4]</a
>
    In addition to voice, the impermeability of the parrot's green feathers was
    associated with Mary's virginity. The combination of these elements identify
    the bird as an "angelic messenger."<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""
>[5]</a
>
    Beyond the association with the Virgin, Carol Purtle explains that because the
    Christ Child is playing with the bird, the parakeet places the scene in
    heaven, rather than in an earthly paradise.<a
        href="#_edn6"
        name="_ednref6"
        title=""
>[6]</a
>
    Instead of having it serve as a messenger to the Virgin, van Eyck
    intentionally placed the parrot in Christ's hands, relating it to both the
    Child and His mother. Mary and Christ were often understood to be the new Adam
    and Eve, and the bird thought to be from Paradise, positioned between, them
    may allude to this succession. By making the viewer recall the original
    residents of Paradise, the parrot's presence works with the tapestry hung
    behind the group. The cloth's rose pattern and green background refer to
    enclosed gardens: Eden, metaphors for Mary's virginity, and, in literature of
    the time, "a mystic setting for transcendent experience."<a
        href="#_edn7"
        name="_ednref7"
        title=""
>[7]</a
>
</p>
<p>
    Carol Purtle and John Ward have both argued that the canon is having a vision
    of his postmortem introduction to Christ in heaven, rather than the grouping
    of mother, Child, and saints being physically present in the church in which
    Canon van der Paele prays.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a>
    This interpretation clarifies the parrot's participation in the scene. The
    panel was commissioned for van der Paele's tomb as his health declined,
    meaning that it was created with a particular awareness of the his mortality.
    Known for its greeting of "<i>Ave</i>" and its association with Paradise, the
    parrot turns to him and welcomes him to heaven.<a

    Van Eyck's composition of the Virgin and Child with a green parakeet was
    imitated again and again over the course of the next century and a half.<a

    After Columbus's voyages and the arrival of American parrots in Europe
    however, we begin to see parrots appear in art more often and in more diverse
    settings. We also see a greater diversity in the species represented. At this
    later point in time, art begins to trend towards depicting macaws, a group of
    parrot subspecies native to the Americas. Over the course of the sixteenth
    century, Europeans became accustomed to these new parrots and began depicting
    them alongside African and Asian species. By the seventeenth century, parrots
    of all kinds were relatively common in Europe and appeared with some
    regularity in still lives as well as narrative scenes.<a

<p>
    As Europe first began familiarizing itself with the new lands across the
    Atlantic, many explorers remarked upon the large flocks of parrots. Some took
    finding a species associated with India as a sign that they were in India, or
    at least somewhere like it. In October of 1492, Columbus wrote, "other than
    parrots, I have seen no beast of any kind on this island."<a

        name="_ednref12"

    He refers to parrots several more times in the journals describing first
    voyage. In 1493, Peter Martyr wrote "the parrots brought from [the Caribbean]
    and many other things show that these islands taste of the soil of India,
    either because of their proximity or because of their natural properties,"
    revealing how for Europeans, parrots connected the Americas to Asia.<a
        href="#_edn13"
        name="_ednref13"
        title=""

    When Pedro Cabral landed in Brazil in 1500, he wrote that this "new
    land...[is] that of the parrots."<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""
>[14]</a
>
    As Europe familiarized itself with the Americas, parrots came to symbolize the
    mysterious lands across the Atlantic. Geographically located to the west of
    Europe, the Americas were often understood to be an extension of the East and
    from Europeans' first landings on these shores, the presence of parrots seemed
    to confirm this idea.
</p>
<p>
    As the 'New World', a term used to refer to newly discovered lands in Asia as
    well as America, was charted through maps, parrots became emblematic of
    certain parts of the world.They often appear on other maps as illustrations
    within the landmasses of Africa and what a modern viewer would now understand
    to be South America, thought to be part of Asia.<a

        name="_ednref15"

    Possibly the earliest map depicting parrots in Asia is the Ebstorf Mappamundi
    from the thirteenth century.<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""

    The map centers on a heavenly Jerusalem and is oriented with East at the top
    of the map. A depiction of Christ's head is in the East, marking the top of
    the map, and just below it, to the right of the two rivers that flow into
    Christ, is a parrot.<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a>

    The Cantino Planisphere, printed in 1502, is one of the first maps to depict
    the new lands visited by Columbus.<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""

>
    <img
            width="100%"

    />
</p>
<p>Fig. 3: Cantino Planisphere, ca. 1502, Biblioteca Estense, Modena, Italy.</p>
<p>
    It is also the first to use parrots to mark this land mass.<a
        href="#_edn19"
        name="_ednref19"
        title=""
>[19]</a
>
    These new lands are shown as ambiguously shaped, making it clear that they are
    not yet fully explored. With no border or coast in the West, Cantino leaves
    the possibility that the mass we now call South America may continue on into
    Asia. This idea is confirmed by the map's original title,
    <i
    >Carta de navigar per le Isole nouam tr[ovate] in le parte de India: dono
        Alberto Cantino al S. Duca Hercole</i
    >
    or
    <i
    >Map for navigating the new islands found in part of India: a gift by
        Alberto Cantino for S. Duke Hercole</i
    >. Though he is depicting unexplored territory, Cantino follows Columbus's
    example and assimilates it into Europe's existing understanding of the world
    by describing it as part of India. The familiar green parrots of modern-day
    Senegal and African Grey Parrots of Central Africa are contrasted with the
    bright red macaws of America.
</p>
<p>
    Vopel indicates Cabral's "land of the parrots" twice. First, it appears in its
    Italian translation, "<i>Papagalli terra" </i>on the landmass we now recognize
    as South America. The second appearance of parrots is in a fictional land
    placed in the same location as Antarctica. They are depicted in the eastern
    half of a land mass labeled as "<i>Antarcticus</i>" and "<i
>Terra Australis nondum cognita</i
>," which translates to "southern land not yet known". The birds are
    represented by an illustration of three parrots accompanied by the phrase "<i
>Psitacorum Terra</i
>" &#8211; the Latin translation of Cabral's words. This phrase often included
    when maps depict <i>Terra Australis</i>.<a

</p>
<p>
    Europeans' efforts to understand new flora and fauna by distributing them
    geographically on maps was complicated by the absence of a clear taxonomic
    system. Although of different subspecies and modern taxonomic families,
    monkeys and parrots could be found in Africa, Asia, and South America.<a
        href="#_edn21"
        name="_ednref21"
        title=""
>[21]</a
>
    The effort to represent traditionally understood distributions even as new
    species within these orders were encountered may have contributed to the
    understanding that the Americas were an extension of Asia. This interpretation
    of the new lands may account for why, after Columbus's voyages, parrots appear
    less in places believed to be Asia in the East and more in places believed to
    be Asia in the West. The assembling of different species under the order
    Psitacciformes became representative of the 'New World' as a whole, the place
    where East and West meet.
</p>
<p>
    Because the Americas were originally considered by Europeans to be a
    continuation of Asia around the other side of the world, it was logical to
    place Eden, in the farthest East: in the Americas. The first known use of a
    parrot in a Temptation scene is Albrecht Dürer's 1504
    <i>Adam and Eve</i>engraving.<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title=""
>[22]</a

<p>

    />

</p>
<p>
    Erwin Panofsky's analysis of the bird above Adam suggests that its presence is
    meant to offset the evil of the serpent behind Eve. This is consistent with
    pre-Columbian associations between parrots and the purity of virginity. The
    long tail on Dürer's parrot points to it being an American species. Dürer had
    at three parrots in his household: his wife had a small green one, likely to
    be an Indian bird, and he received one from Málaga.<a
        href="#_edn23"
        name="_ednref23"
        title=""
>[23]</a
>
    It is unclear if the third parrot was a second green one or a second from
    Málaga but it is reasonable to guess that it came as one in a pair. We do not
    know what species Dürer's parrot was, but coming from a city on the coast of
    Spain, it is likely that it was a macaw from a Spanish territory in the
    Americas.
</p>
<p>
    By the 1520s, parrots had become so popular in Spain that explorers no longer
    felt the need to include them in their listings of American species. When
    writing about the animals of the 'New World' in 1526, Gonzalo Fernandez de
    Oviedo does not mention parrots at all. He glosses over their exclusion by
    explaining that it is a waste of time and writing space to discuss species
    that are already readily available in Spain.<a
        href="#_edn24"
        name="_ednref24"
        title=""
>[24]</a
>
    There is archaeological evidence to support this widespread trade in exotic
    birds. Two parrot bones dated to the seventeenth century were found at
    Norwich's Castle Mall, which was certainly not a hub of cosmopolitan activity
    at the time.<a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title="">[25]</a> The number of
    macaw species represented by artists like Peter Paul Rubens and the increasing
    representations of parrots through the seventeenth century indicate the
    booming market for exotic birds.<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title=""
>[26]</a
>
</p>
<p>
    By examining parrots, we see how Europeans assimilated the new variety of
    birds into their existing notions of Paradise and the associated iconography.
    As they explored the region and better understood its geography, parrots came
    to symbolize the Americas and the expansion of Europe's interactivity with the
    world. Parrots came to gain their own meaning to Europeans, independent of
    their Amerasian origins. Bruce Boehrer notes how the increasing appearance of
    parrots in still lives through the seventeenth century demonstrates their
    change in status. Prior to 1492, they had served as angelic messengers to men.
    In the sixteenth century, they were emblems of Amerasia. By the seventeenth
    century, they had been demoted to locally available commodities.

        Carles Oliver Torell—'s identification of the green African parrots. She
        identifies them as Gray Senegal Parrots. There are, however, two sets of
        parrots on the Cantino Planisphere's African continent. One set, indeed
        depicted over modern-day Senegal, are entirely green. Without the yellow
        sides and gray heads, they look less like Senegal Parrots and more like
        Ring-Necked Parakeets, also native to this part of Africa. The second set of
        parrots are shown over modern-day Nigera and Cameroon. These birds must be
        African Gray Parrots as they are native to this region and are accurately
        depicted by Cantino. Joan Carles Oliver Torell—, "A Spy, a Map, and the

        <a href="#_ednref20" name="_edn20" title="">[20]</a>The placement of parrots
        in Terra Australis invites investigation into the ideas of the fictional
        land that wouldn't be disproven until James Cook's voyages in the South
        Seas. While worth examination, Terra Australis falls outside the scope of
        this project. For more information on it, see Alfred Hiatt,
        <i>Terra Incognita: Mapping the Antipodes Before 1600</i> (Chicago:
        University of Chicago Press, 2008).
