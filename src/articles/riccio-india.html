<h1>
    <i>India </i>and <i>indiano</i>: The persistence of Amerasia in the Italian
    language
</h1>
<h2>Vittoria Riccio</h2>
<p>
    In the top left corner of his large-scale, printed, twelve-sheet map of the
    world, the German mapmaker Caspar Vopel inscribed this part of his map with
    the regional label of ÔINDIA ORIENTALISÕ. In tracing the history of Ô<i
>IndiaÕ</i
>
    and its derivatives in the Italian language, it will immediately appear clear
    that we are dealing with a fluid and multifaceted term that overcomes the
    boundaries of its most immediate meaning. The origin of the word has a
    geographical nature: it derives from the Greek <i>&#7992;</i
><i>&#957;&#948;&#943;</i><i>&#945; </i>(<i>India</i>)<i>, </i>which indicated
    the land of the Indus River (<i>Sindhu </i>in Sanskrit, <i>Hindu</i> in Old
    Persian); the people inhabiting those regions were called <i>&#7992;</i
><i>&#957;&#948;&#959;&#943;</i> (<i>Indoi</i>). In its Latin form,
    <i>India</i> transmigrated into Italian vernaculars and was often used as an
    attribute for precious goods, such as minerals and pigments.<a

    Since Antiquity, India represented an <i>other</i> place, a remote land
    inhabited by monsters and bizarre creatures in the minds of the Ancient
    Greeks, or the location of Terrestrial Paradise in the Middle Ages. These two
    extremes speak about a distance that is not only spatial, and that makes India
    a fantastic repository of supernatural otherness. The traditional ÒconfusionÓ
    between India and Ethiopia perfectly exemplifies this tendency.<a

</p>
<p>
    The discovery of the New World marks the beginning of a new life for Ô<i
>IndiaÕ; </i
>the sixteenth century represents, in fact, the apex of this longstanding
    philological disorder. It is well known how Christopher Columbus, certain he
    had landed in Marco PoloÕs Orient, became the first player in a linguistic
    misunderstanding that still persists today. A visual example can be observed
    in world maps and globes from the sixteenth century that concretely show the
    ubiquity of India; in Caspar VopelÕs World Map, for instance, we find several
    <i>Indie</i>, disseminated around Asia, America and Africa. It is important,
    however, to separate the historical ÒerrorÓ from the linguistic and cultural
    one; the former, resolved in a few decades with VespucciÕs famed intuition,
    was only the spark that gave life to the latter.
</p>
<p>
    The five editions of the <i>Vocabolario</i
><i> degli Accademici della Crusca</i> are the perfect tool to investigate
    this evolution. The last publication describes India as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
    From the well-known regions of Asia and America designated by this name, and
    rich of rare and precious products, India, and more often the plural Indies
    denotes, informally and figuratively, Great abundance of any thing, or any
    thing that is necessary, and sometimes even ÔGood fortuneÕ, ÔWealthÕ, ÔSource
    of wealthÕ and more; and it is used as ÔHaving India or the IndiesÕ, ÔBeing
    there India or IndiesÕ, ÔFinding the IndiesÕ [É] ¤ II. To come from the Indies
    means to come from remote places with customs and uses different from ours;
    and jokingly applied to those who do not know, or seem to ignore, the customs,
    or famous facts, of the place where they arrive, or where they are.
    <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
    This definition is permeated by a sense of flexibility that speaks to us about
    the multivalence of the term. India is not only a country, it is an entity
    (link to India Extra Gangem entry).<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""
>[4]</a
>
    The geographical indicators only serve to blur its physical borders; Asia and
    America play an equal role in shaping its identity. India is a synonym for
    Wealth and Abundance and, at the same time, a remote land that is
    unquestionably different from us. The term becomes a container for any sort of
    thing, almost a shape-shifting body that adapts, from time to time, to our
    needs. We will see, however, how this apparently universal and fixed value is,
    indeed, more subtle, precise and variegated.
</p>
<p>
    The entry for Ô<i>indiano</i><i>Õ</i> provides interesting material as well:
</p>
<blockquote>
    Properly used as Ôof India or the IndiesÕ, ÔBelonging to the IndiesÕ; and said
    of a person ÔNative of the IndiesÕ; and informally in the manner of Ô<i
>Fare lÕindianoÕ</i
>
    (ÔActing like an IndianÕ), which means pretending to ignore what one knows
    about acts, facts, or persons, practices, manipulations and more; almost to
    make it seem to be from the Indies, or another very distant place and
    therefore not informed at all of the things of the country. Same as ÔFare il
    nesciÕ or ÔFare lo gnorriÕ [É].
    <a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
    The idea of distance returns in this second definition, especially in the
    idiom Ô<i>fare lÕindiano</i>Õ or Ôto pretend to ignore something as if you
    were coming from such a remote land that you could not be informed of the
    facts of this countryÕ. The definition of the <i>Vocabolario</i>, however,
    oddly overlooks the consideration of the Indian diffused in the sixteenth
    century. The travel literature, the letters, and the accounts of the explorers
    all agree on defining the indigenous populations of the Americas as shy,
    timid, and na•ve,<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> an idea
    that easily translates into a negative conception of the <i>indio</i>, which
    becomes a synonym of uncultured, pagan, and savage.
    <a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a> <i>ÔIndiano</i>Õ and
    <i>Ôfare lÕindiano</i>Õ evoke the same idea of remoteness enclosed in the
    definition of <i>India</i>, but at the same time they imply a moral and
    cultural judgement. Curiously, the idiom stimulates a question that contains
    in itself the first germs of the Amerasian problem: which <i>indiano</i> are
    we referring to? The reference to the na•vetŽ inevitably points at the
    Amerindians, but the Ôfaraway landÕ corresponds to the Indies, East or West we
    cannot know.
</p>
<p>
    One last observation on the <i>Vocabolario</i> regards chronology. The entries
    discussed above only appear in the fifth edition, published between 1843 and
    1923, and they are still valid today. Therefore, we are discussing a
    relatively recent definition, and this raises a series of questions on the use
    of the term in the sixteenth century and the origin of the insightful
    description that we find in the nineteenth century. The only obvious mention
    of India, present since the first edition of 1612, is the term Ô<i>indico</i
><i>Õ.</i> <a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a> This eloquent
    absence, however, is not translated into an equivalent silence: Ô<i>IndiaÕ </i
>and Ô<i>indiano</i><i>Õ </i>populate the vocabulary, infiltrating the
    definitions of many terms, from Ô<i>gallo</i>Õ to Ô<i>pepe</i>Õ, to
    Ô<i>caldo</i>Õ and Ô<i>tamarindi</i>Õ. The occurrence of such attributes,
    moreover, multiplies from one publication to the other, to the extreme cases
    of Ô<i>poleggio</i><i>Õ </i>and Ô<i>porcellino</i>Õ, in which reference to
    India appears only in the fourth edition (1729-38) and is supplemented by a
    rather longer definition. The use of India as an attribute is a clear allusion
    to the ideas of abundance and distance and it refers, at the same time, to the
    various historical conception related to it. The natural abundance of the
    Garden of Eden, for instance, or the tales of mythical reigns refulgent of
    gold and silver <a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a> could have
    explained, in the Western mind, the profusion of products flooding the
    European markets. (On the mapping of Paradise, see the entry on DRACONIS). It
    is not surprising, then, that the nomenclature <i>ÔdÕIndiaÕ </i>or
    <i>Ôdelle Indie</i>Õ was applied to plants, fruits, animals and luxury goods,
    especially if we consider the mercantile culture of the Italian peninsula,
    whose contacts with the East were mainly commercial. After 1492, the arrival
    of American goods in Europe encountered this sort of mentality, which resulted
    in an extension of the nomenclature to these new products. Whether West or
    East Indies, these goods were coming from distant countries and therefore
    their cost was higher; in this sense, Ô<i>indiano</i>Õ acquires a further
    semantic level, denoting more generally things with a non-European provenance,
    or Ôexotic.Õ
</p>
<p>
    A perfect example of the various uses of Ô<i>IndiaÕ</i> and Õ<i> indiano</i
><i>Õ </i>is Giorgio Vasari. The first meaning we encounter is the simplest
    one:reminiscent of medieval writers and contemporary merchants, he uses the
    attribute Ô<i>dÕIndia</i><i>Õ </i>or Ô<i>indiano</i><i>Õ</i> in reference to
    animals.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a> In other cases,
    Vasari indeed refers to the continent America, therefore using
    <i>ÔIndieÕ </i>with a precise geographical intent.
</p>
<p>
    One example of this is the description of the Guardaroba in Palazzo Vecchio,
    where Ignazio Danti painted Ôthe Tables of Ptolemy, all measured with perfect
    accuracy and corrected after the most recent authorities, with exact charts of
    navigation and their scales for measuring and degrees, done with supreme
    diligence; and with these are all the names, both ancient and modernÕ.<a
        href="#_edn11"
        name="_ednref11"
        title=""
>[11]</a
>
    The tables accurately described by Vasari depict the known world, which, he
    tells us, is divided in four equal parts: Europe, Africa, Asia and the West
    Indies.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a> The Indies are
    mentioned again in relation to the portrait of Amerigo Vespucci Ôwho made the
    voyages to the Indies,Õ
    <a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a> and one last time in the
    description of the Palazzo degli Spini, in Florence:
</p>
<blockquote>
    But to return to the space of the faade which, turning from the straight, was
    supported against the Palazzo degli Spini. In it was seen, painted in
    chiaroscuro, a Nymph all unadorned and little less than nude, placed between
    many new kinds of animals, who stood for the new land of Peru, with the other
    new West Indies, discovered and ruled for the most part under the auspices of
    the most fortunate House of Austria.<a
        href="#_edn14"
        name="_ednref14"
        title=""
>[14]</a
>
</blockquote>
<p>
    The recognition of the existence of a fourth part of the world, equal and
    separated from the other continents, does not stop Vasari from using the word
    Ô<i>indiano</i>Õ in and ambiguous and fluid manner, sometimes as a mere
    signifier for ÔexoticÕ or ÔforeignÕ, sometimes charged with deeper meanings.
    The idea of distance is present in his description of the
    <a
            href="https://www.uffizi.it/opere/adorazione-dei-magi-9f5c2075-8e8f-4883-b3ce-62fc6625a2b4#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=1"
            target="_blank"
    >Adoration of the Magi</a
    >
    (1496) by Filippino Lippi. The painting, commissioned by the friars of San
    Donato Scopeto, illustrates the Augustinian tradition, specifically the
    <i>Homilies </i>of Saint Augustine. According to the text, on that day Christ
    was offered to the adoration of pagans, alluding to his mission as the Savior
    of all the people of the world. The crowded scene is filled with Indians,
    Moors and bizarre costumes,<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""
>[15]</a
>
    an expedient through which Lippi illustrates the <i>Homilies</i> and Vasari
    narrates them; turbans and camels, pearls and sandals in the painting have the
    same value that the words Ô<i>indiani</i>Õ and Ô<i>MoriÕ</i> have in the text.

</p>
<p>
    A similar concept is at work in the
    <a
            href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Andrea_del_Sarto_-_Triumph_of_Caesar_-_WGA00382.jpg"
            target="_blank"
    >Tribute to Caesar</a
    >
    (1520 ca.) a fresco by Andrea Del Sarto, in the Medicean Villa of Poggio a
    Caiano.
</p>
<p>
    In this picture Andrea, in order to surpass Franciabigio and Jacopo, subjected
    himself to unexampled labour, drawing in it a magnificent perspective-view and
    a very masterly flight of steps, which formed the ascent to the throne of
    C¾sar. And these steps he adorned with very well-designed statues, not being
    content with having proved the beauty of his genius in the variety of figures
    that are carrying on their backs all those different animals, such as the
    figure of an Indian who is wearing a yellow coat, and carrying on his
    shoulders a cage drawn in perspective with some parrots both within it and
    without, the whole being rarely beautiful; and such, also, as some who are
    leading Indian goats, lions, giraffes, panthers, lynxes, and apes, with Moors
    and other lovely things of fancy, all grouped in a beautiful manner and
    executed divinely well in fresco<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""
>[16]</a
>
</p>
<p>
    The most important element in this passage is the Ô<i>figura</i
><i> indiana</i>Õ. The choice of these words poses a problem: why is Vasari
    referring to this figure as ÔIndianÕ? The man is seen from the back, his face
    is not visible; apparently there is nothing that would explain this unusual
    characterization. A closer observation, however, will offer some details that
    could clarify the problem. The figure is wearing pants, traditionally
    associated with an Oriental or Barbaric fashion (especially in an Ancient
    Roman setting); the mention of the yellow cloak could provide another
    explanation if we read it as a reference to the pigment <i>giallo</i
><i> indiano</i>. All these reasons, however, seem feeble, especially if we
    consider that the scene represents Caesar receiving a tribute from foreign
    ambassadors, <a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a> therefore
    justifying the presence of not one, but many, ÒIndians.Ó The text could help
    us understand: Vasari describes the figure focusing the attention on two
    elements: the yellow cloak and the cage with parrots that he is carrying. (On
    parrots, see the entry by <a href="#lipsman-parrots"> Claire Lipsman</a>.) The
    cage is filled with numerous birds, most likely coming from different parts of
    the globe, and is crowned by a magnificent, brightly colored specimen.
    Although not depicted from life, the disposition and color of the feathers and
    the form of the beak seem to suggest an identification with the Scarlet Macaw
    (Ara Macao), native to the Amazon region. The inclusion of an unmistakably
    American parrot reveals that Andrea Del Sarto deliberately chose to reference
    the New World in this work in order to show that people from every corner of
    the Earth, even from the most remote ones, came to pay tribute to Caesar, and
    metaphorically to the Medici.
    <a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a> The placement of the
    figure on the extreme left of the fresco, just as the Americas were ÒplacedÓ
    on the extreme ÒleftÓ of Europe, seems to confirm this hypothesis. It is
    important to note that Del SartoÕs work on painting the scene does not extend
    beyond the figure of Caesar; the right side of the fresco was completed in
    1585 by Alessandro Allori. The later addition perhaps altered the balance of
    the original composition, enclosed between two very well-defined extremes:
    almost Columns of Hercules, the Ô<i>figura</i><i> indiana</i>Õ and Caesar
    serve as pillars; the New World on one side, open and unknown, and, on the
    other side, the embodiment of Rome, the classical center of the world, ideally
    replaced by Florence in the Renaissance. This symbolic system is perfectly
    understood by Vasari, who participates in the iconographical game by calling
    the figure ÔIndianÕ.
</p>
<p>
    Other sixteenth century authors, such as Ariosto and Tasso, follow a similar
    trend. The <i>Orlando Furioso </i>and the <i>Gerusalemme</i
><i> Liberata</i> represent two more examples of the problem of awareness. In
    canto 15 of the <i>Orlando</i>, in a tribute to Charles V and his global
    empire, Ariosto elevates CortŽs to immortal glory and, in an epic parallel,
    Tasso uses his own canto 15 to honor Columbus as one of the most illustrious
    men of his time. The grand encomia paid to the protagonists of the age of
    exploration prove the interest of Italian intellectuals in the matters of the
    New World, but the disjunction of historical events and linguistic tendencies
    is evident in their use of the word Ô<i>indiano</i><i>.</i>Õ TassoÕs
    narration, in particular, is set in an era which could have not been further
    from the problem of India, and yet he celebrates Columbus, while referring to
    Muslim generals and knights as Ô<i>indiano</i>Õ. The word here is a synonym of
    infidel, but in the great praise paid to the courage of the Ô<i>fero</i
><i> indioÕ </i> Adrasto it is free of any negative connotation.
    <a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[19]</a>
</p>
<p>
    Along the same lines, sixteenth and seventeenth century inventories of
    Venetian, Bolognese and Florentine collections confirm the
    historical-philological incoherence and the persistence of the idea of
    Amerasia in the Italian language. In the inventories of the Medici collection,
    for instance, the terms Ô<i>indiano</i>Õ, Ô<i>allÕindiana</i
><i>Õ, ÔdellÕIndiaÕ </i>were alternatively used to denote objects from
    America, Asia, Africa, thus encompassing many things exotic or foreign. Mixtec
    masks Ô<i>allÕindiana</i>Õ, feather robes Ô<i>dellÕIndia</i>Õ were displayed
    together with Asian artifacts in CosimoÕs Guardaroba, the same one described
    by Vasari as a representation of the whole world. The same happens in
    Bolognese and Venetian collections, from the case of Ulisse Aldovrandi and his
    indiscriminate use of Indian and American terms, to the mention of Ôa lizard,
    or another animal from America, the newly rediscovered part of the worldÕused
    in combination with Ô<i>indiano</i><i>Õ </i>or Ô<i>delle</i><i> IndieÕ </i>in
    the <i>Inventario</i>of Andrea Mantova Benavides (1695).
    <a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">[20]</a> (On the Florentine Codex
    owned by Ferdinando I de Medici, see the entry by
    <a href="#raitt-florentinecodex"> Louisa Raitt.</a>)
</p>
<p>
    To observe the occurrence of this phenomenon in visual arts, we can turn to
    Germany. Albrecht AltdorferÕs <i>Christ Crowned with Thorns</i> (1518), part
    of the <i>Saint Sebastian Altar, </i>is a parallel to VasariÕs textual
    fluidity in the realm of images. The background of the painting shows a
    secondary scene,<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[21]</a>
    characterized by the odd presence of a figure that can be easily identified as
    an Amerindian, from the feather headdress to the partial nudity and the club
    resting on his shoulder. The presence of this Indian, at first rather bizarre,
    could be explained by the fact that the scene is set in the Holy Land, a place
    east of Europe, and it represents episodes from the Passion of Christ. A
    character native to the most remote place on Earth, possibly pagan and
    infidel, could help us put a distance between our Christian Europe and the
    barbarous actions perpetrated against Christ.
</p>
<p>
    Altdorfer is also an interesting figure, since his case shares many
    similarities with VasariÕs. Both artists worked in an environment strongly
    fascinated with the New World: in Florence, the Medici were collecting
    American artefacts, just as was happening in Augsburg. The Florentine
    infatuation with the Americas developed during the course of the sixteenth
    century, taking the form of Ludovico ButiÕs frescoes in the Uffizi, or that of
    the Thornton expedition in the seventeenth century. (On the Buti frescoes, see
    the essay
    <a href="#weitzman-armeria">Margo Weitzman.</a>) The Northern artists did not
    remain indifferent: the interest of artists such as DŸrer and Burkmair (part
    of the same circle of Altdorfer) is evident in their drawings and
    illustrations, and the <i>Triumph of Maximilian I</i> (1518) could be
    considered the final phase of the evolution of this interest. The
    <a
            href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/431769"
            target="_blank"
    >People of Calicut</a
    >, part of the procession in honor of the Emperor in the <i>Triumphs,</i> are
    the representation of this culture of exchanges, symbolizing at the same time
    the notions of extremities and fusion in a propagandistic and celebratory
    context. Expressly depicting Asian populations,
    <a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[22]</a> they are characterized by
    a mixture of feather headdresses, Brazilian clubs and elephants, becoming the
    perfect embodiment of this combination of Asia and America, historical
    awareness and linguistic neglect.
</p>
<p>
    In conclusion, Ô<i>indiano</i>Õ and <i>ÔIndia</i>Õ were extremely ambiguous
    terms in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. They could acquire positive
    connotations or negative meanings, allude to distant and wealthy lands while
    hinting at familiar notions; they could refer to infidel savages and at the
    same time denote precious and luxurious product. The continuous use of these
    words in an undefined and malleable manner perfectly shows how, after more
    than five centuries, the mentality of Amerasia survives in our everyday
    language.

    <p class="Footnote">
        <a href="#_ednref2" name="_edn2" title="">[2]</a> From a linguistic point of
        view, Dante provides a helpful example. Purg.VII.74 poses a series of
        problems of interpretation. Scholars usually identify <i>indico </i>with
        <i>indaco</i> (the blue pigment), but some propose that the words
        <i>indico</i> and <i>legno</i> should be read together, therefore indicating
        ebony (see Virgil, <i>Sola India nigrum fert hebanum</i>, Georg.II). Ebony
        is a type of wood typical of Ethiopia, as well as Asian regions such as
        Indochina and Sri Lanka. If we accept the second interpretation, this could
        exemplify the persistence of an India-Ethiopia overlap in the languages of
        12th century Italy. A second example of this is the conflation of Ethiopia
        and India in the <i>Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca</i>, for
