<h1>CAROLUS IMPER<em>ATOR</em> QUINTUS</h1>

<p>
    No ruler dominates the iconography of this map more than Charles V, Holy Roman
    Emperor and King of Spain at the time this map was designed. A combined
    imperial and Spanish coat of arms presides over the entire map, top center,
    and his figure appears twice, here in the Ocean between Europe and Amerasia
    and also in the Mediterranean, where he is shown after his defeat of the
    Ottoman Turks at Tunis in 1535. In the Mediterranean, his feet are shown
    planted along the northern African coast west of Tunis, significantly close to
    MAURITANIA CAESARI<em>ENSIS</em>, the colony founded and named by the Roman
    emperors Augustus and Claudia in the first century CE. There Charles V is
    shown striding westward, as if indicating a turn to the rest of the world
    across the Western Ocean. There, between the two words OCEANUS and OCCIDU[U]S,
    near the center of the entire map and by far the largest figure on it, sits
    the enthroned figure of Charles V, looking still farther westward towards the
    newly discovered lands in America and Asia. On one side of his throne are the
    imperial coat of arms, on the other the Spanish coat of arms, a reference to
    his two crowns. He is installed in a tabernacle flanked by two columns, a
    clear reference to the columns of Hercules, placed by the mythical hero at the
    mouth of the Mediterranean Sea on either side of the Strait of Gibraltar
    (labeled on the map FRETUM HERCULANEUM) to mark the westernmost extent of the
    known world. In the <em>Republic</em>, Plato told the legend of the lost realm
    of Atlantis, which lay beyond the pillars of Hercules to the West until it was
    submerged by the waters, the MARE ATLANTICUM to the West of Africa and Europe.
    As early as Pindar and in the writings of several medieval authors, the
    columns were interpreted as a warning to the prudent not to navigate beyond
    this limit. In the <em>Inferno</em> (26, 104-8), for example, Dante says that
    with the columns Hercules had signaled a warning “that man should not go
    farther beyond (<em
>dov’Ercule segnò li suoi riguardi/ acciochè l’uom più oltre non is
    metta</em
>).” On the Vopel map, the two columns flanking the figure of Charles V carry
    banderoles bearing his device, the aggressive and affirmative PLUS VLTRA ([go]
    farther or beyond), in contravention of the ancient and medieval warning, a
    clear reference here to the Spanish explorations and conquests in the New
    World.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> To make the point
    unambiguously, the figure of Charles V, with his cross-topped imperial orb in
    one hand and a sword in the other, is turned towards the new lands in the
    West, his mouth open as if in a battle cry.
