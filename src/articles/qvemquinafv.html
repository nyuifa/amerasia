<p>
    Quemquinafu on Vopel’s map is a Latinization of Quanzhou, the city Polo refers
    to as Zaiton/Zayton, the port in Eastern China where Polo discovered porcelain
    and then left to travel back to Europe by boat. Polo describes it as “one of
    the…ports in the world with the biggest flow of merchandise,” stirring
    sixteenth-century imaginings of the Asian wealth to be found in the
    exploration of the Americas.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> Placing
    it about fifteen degrees north of <em>Messigo</em>, Vopel similarly tells us
    that “This kingdom was once wealthy and most powerful. It abounds in silk”
    (<em>Hoc regnum fuit olim opulentum et/ maximum, abundat serico</em>). On the
    Johannes Ruysch map, included in the 1507 Roman edition of Ptolemy’s
    Geography, as well as many other period maps, Zaiton appears at the end of a
    peninsula on the coast of China; on the Vopel map, however, although a port,
    Quemquinafu appears in the center of the Amerasian landmass, though a memory
    of the alternative toponym and the port function is retained: if we follow the
    river from Quemquinafu towards the coast, we arrive at <em>Zoilon portus</em>,
    the port of Zoilon. Vopel seems to have split Quemquinafu/Zaiton into an
    inland kingdom and a connected coastal port.
