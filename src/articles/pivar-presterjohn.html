    <h1>Prester John and The Search for a Christian Utopia</h1>
    <h2>Larimore Hampton Pivar</h2>
    <p>The coinage of the city of Axum proves the acceptance of Christianity in Ethiopia in the third and fourth
        centuries.  Although informed by trade-related interests, the decision to embrace Christianity laid the
        foundation for the myth of Prester John.<a

                name="pivar_ednref1"
                title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> The kingdom of Axum was vanquished by the 12<sup>th</sup> century and the
        seat of power moved to the new capital at Roha, now Lalibela. It is the reign of Lalibela that is most
        frequently identified with the Prester John story.</p>
    <p>Prester John’s existence was first recorded in the literature of the 12<sup>th</sup> century, although there had
        been rumors of sightings centuries before Otto of Freising documented the fable of Prester John in his <i>Chronica
            sice Historia de duabus civitatibus</i> of 1145, where we are told of a rumor of “a certain John, a king and
        priest who dwells beyond Persia and Armenia in the uttermost East. . . . It is said that he is a lineal
        descendant of the Magi, of whom mention is made in the Gospel.”<a
                href="#pivar_edn2"
                name="pivar_ednref2"
                title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a>  These rumors fed the desire for more concrete evidence, soon to come in a
        [supposed] letter from Prester John to the Pope in Rome, from 1165. The many adaptations of the <i>Letter </i>advanced
        Prester John’s legend, according to which he was “ruling in ‘India,’ a geographical expression that to Europeans
        in 1165 and later meant nothing more specific than a land lying to the east.”<a
                href="#pivar_edn3"
                name="pivar_ednref3"
                title=""><sup>[3]</sup></a> The <i>Letter</i> further referred to his domain extending over ‘three
        Indies,’ which in the European vernacular of the period referred to a vague tripartite categorization of the
        land masses beyond the Arab world into Lesser, Greater, and Middle India. Likewise, the Ethiopian people would
        be designated Indians.<a href="#pivar_edn4"

                                 title=""><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>
    <p>With increasing European trade with Cathay and the possibility of making a pact with the Mongols in the fight
        against the Muslims, the <i>Letter</i> spurred on Marco Polo’s quest in the East from 1271 to 1295. All of the
        accounts in the literature portray Prester John as a powerful Christian, or Nestorian, king who ruled a land
        that can only be described as utopian, a land of abundance and wealth and peace. As what often occurs with the
        synchronicity of the collective consciousness, Prester John is to be found [in the literature] in
        places<sup> </sup>associated with the geopolitical and religious zeitgeist. Prester John’s importance to the
        medieval Christian world is prodigious as it perpetuates the notion that a failing Christendom is not inevitable
        and that continued expansion of its realm is attainable.<a href="#pivar_edn5"
                                                                   name="pivar_ednref5"

        and fifteenth centuries the dissemination of the legend of Prester John shifted him from Asia to Ethiopia, as a
        reflection of cartographical amendments to the fusion of eastern Asia and eastern Africa.<a

    <p>To understand the scope of Prester John’s grip on the European imagination it is necessary not only to read the
        literature but to consider visual representations. Depictions of Prester John and his realm are ubiquitous early
        on, most notably in maps, as European cartographers’ dependence on maps was a crucial element in pinpointing the
        location of Prester John. According to Carlson, any map depicting Africa during the 300 years after Marco Polo
        was not considered complete without picturing or referencing Prester John.<a href="#pivar_edn10"
                                                                                     name="pivar_ednref10"
                                                                                     title=""><sup>[10]</sup></a> These
        cartographers appear to locate Prester John in places that produced the least confusion about the changing
        world. Prester John’s prominence of place on maps was due to a desire to ascribe certainty to the inconstant and
        mutable worldview. Maps from the Middle Ages had depicted Ethiopia and India as bordering land massed, with the
        Indian Ocean severely reduced. In the Age of Exploration European cosmographers divided India in two parts,
        Indus and the Ganges and Beyond the Ganges, with Africa depicted separately.</p>

        Prester John is located in Africa and is depicted as a dark-skinned ruler sitting on a throne in a tent,
        surrounded by other rulers of the continent. While clearly not a European, he wears contemporary European
        clothing and a crown, holds a scepter, and appears very imperial.</p>

        which is said to be India. Whether the artists were aware of it or not, they were portraying the Prester as they

                                                                                                                           name="pivar_ednref24"
                                                                                                                           title=""><sup>[24]</sup></a> 
        the artist portrays Prester John as a dark-skinned ruler of Ethiopia meeting with Jesuit priests, with the
        Prester clad in Renaissance attire seated atop a base and surrounded by the lushness of a tropical
        country---tall stylized palm trees, heraldic angels and a curtained backdrop with the frontispiece of the book
        shown directly behind him. This depiction veers more towards a vision of the Prester John and his realm as part
        of a new world being approached by foreigners, although it is known that Jesuit priests had long been involved
        in missionary work in Ethiopia.  Some of the Prester’s attendants appear apprehensive of the European visitors,
        their eyes seeing “foreigners,” with the European artist viewing the Prester and his realm as the “other.”  The
        image depicts an odd confluence of confusion, presenting Ethiopia as a New World.</p>
